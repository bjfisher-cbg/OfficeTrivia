      "The Day of the Annual Christmas Party at Dunder Mifflin Scranton.",
      "When Michael arrives, Pam gives him a gift bag. He mistakenly thinks it's from Pam but she explains it's from corporate headquarters.",
      "Carol receives her Christmas card from Michael and visits him to voice her disapproval of his Photoshopping himself into a two-year-old ski weekend photo with her children and former husband (Michael replaces her husband's face with his own).",
      "Carol breaks off the relationship, leaving Michael (who has already booked a trip for the two of them to Sandals Resorts) heartbroken.",
      "Pam gives Jim her gift: she has been sending Dwight messages from the CIA for several months and she's going to let Jim decide the top secret mission that Dwight will go on.",
      "Dwight realizes that the office is one bathrobe-from-corporate short, and a depressed Michael \"solves\" the problem by telling Dwight to take Toby's.",
      "Karen attempts to offer several party suggestions, and although they get support from other members, Angela immediately nixes all of her ideas and asks her to leave for having stupid ideas.",
      "Karen and Pam decide to organize their own Margarita-Karaoke party.",
      "Jim, being \"Number #2\", creates The Committee To Determine The Validity Of The Two Committees on the spot (consisting only of himself) and declares Pam and Karen's committee to be valid.",
      "Andy decides to take Michael out to help him forget about his troubles; Michael summons his \"entourage\" Jim, Ryan and Dwight to come along, though Ryan opts out with a long list of excuses he's prepared for such an invitation from Michael.",
      "Pam and Karen begin their party in the breakroom and Angela is quick to start her own in the conference room.",
      "Kevin tells the camera that he is mainly convinced to go because he has heard that Angela's party will have double-fudge brownies, and that outweighs the fact that Angela herself will be there.",
      "Michael, Andy, Jim, and Dwight arrive at a Benihana restaurant (which Michael refers to as \"Asian Hooters\").",
      "Andy convinces Michael to ask out his Japanese waitress after getting him slightly drunk. So drunk, in fact, that he actually steals meat from the plate of Justin Spitzer, which causes a quick chopstick-swordfight between them.",
      "Ryan makes the discovery at the party that they do not have a power cord for their karaoke machine, but Darryl offers to get his synthesizer as an alternative.",
      "Meredith is seen with a bottle of vodka in her hand, turning down the margaritas because they are \"too sweet\".",
      "Angela's party proceeds to get more uncomfortable as Angela makes a dig at Kevin's weight, irritating him enough to drive him to the other party. When Michael, Andy, Jim, and Dwight return with two of the waitresses from Benihana, Michael finds Angela's party to be \"lame.\" Kevin uses this moment to escape. Angela is comforted by Dwight's attendance at her party (even though he went to the other party first) until Karen and Pam come in and inform Dwight that he's won the raffle from their party. Dwight wins walkie-talkies, which he uses later in the episode to communicate with Angela, using their pet names for one another, \"monkey\" and \"possum\".",
      "Pam notices how upset Angela is, and she and Karen make an offer to Angela to merge the two parties. Angela agrees and reveals that she stole the power cord for the karaoke machine. As everyone has fun singing, Michael—who is very drunk—confuses his date with Andy's since, as he states, \"all waitresses look alike.\" He goes into the kitchen where both the waitresses are and he discreetly tries to ask aloud where his one was and finally she acknowledges herself and he discreetly marks her arm with a marker.",
      "The two waitresses leave because they say the party \"blows\", and Michael offers his girl a trip to Sandals Jamaica, where he was going to take Carol. She says no since she has classes, although she does take a bike that Michael had intended to give to the charity toy drive.",
      "A depressed Michael sulks on the couch and Jim comes up and joins him. Jim gets Michael to laugh at the whole situation and lets him realize that what he had with the waitress was nothing more than a rebound. Jim then tells Michael that a rebound is a fun distraction, but when it is over, \"you're still thinking about the girl you're really after—the one who broke your heart\" (echoing Jim's relationship with Karen after his being rejected by Pam). The two sit in silence as they think.",
      "Pam gives Toby her robe from corporate that Dwight had taken.",
      "Michael makes a phone call to an unknown person to ask her to accompany him to Sandals and the person says yes.",
      "Oscar and Gil return from their three-month vacation in Europe. Looking around, Oscar says \"Too soon\" and leaves.",

Afterwards, he announces to the office that the employee with the highest chip count will get a mini-fridge and $500 to donate to the charity of their choice.

Jim is all for this choice but Pam is embarrassed about it and prevents him from asking Kevin. Michael's real-estate agent Carol calls to set up an appointment to sign his insurance papers for his mortgage and he asks her to come to the festivities. In the middle of the call, Michael takes a call from Jan, who tells him that she has decided to come to the casino night after all. When he returns to Carol's call, she also accepts his invitation. Michael states that he has \"two queens\" for the Casino Night and that he is going to \"drop a deuce on everyone.\"",

Creed reveals that he is a kleptomaniac, stealing chips, money, and various items from work and at Casino Night. Michael loses all of his money to Toby early in Texas hold 'em. Jan arrives and tells Michael she is okay with Carol. Dwight wins at craps and kisses Angela on the cheek. She slaps him and walks away with a grin on her face (Dwight has a smirk, too). Jim confronts Ryan about his relationship with Kelly, to which Ryan responds with a sheepish grin in the affirmative. Jim tries to check to see if Pam is bluffing in poker, which she isn't.",

Jan and Jim share a scene outside, where she laments ever hooking up with Michael. She asks him if he has thought about the transfer, which he says he has. Jan suggests that he talk to someone in the office about it. Creed ends up winning the mini-fridge due to all the chips he has stolen, saying that it will be the first refrigerator he has owned.  Roy leaves the party early despite Pam's requests that he stay.",
      "Jim approaches Pam because he needs to talk to her, presumably to tell her about the possibility of him transferring to Stamford. Instead, he blurts out that he is in love with her. She asks why he is telling her, to which he replies that he wanted her to know. After a stunned pause, she states she cannot be with him. He tells her he wants to be more than friends, but she is sorry he \"misinterpreted things.\" With tears in his eyes, he states he is sorry he misinterpreted their friendship and discreetly wipes a tear from his cheek as he walks away.",

They are also upset that Michael treats Pam and Ryan with more respect because they were the only people to follow him to his new company, with Michael believing his company operates within the branch despite the buyout.

Michael reluctantly agrees to give back their clients. In doing so, however, there are not enough clients to keep both Pam and Ryan on the sales team, leaving Michael to decide which one to keep. He talks it over with Jim, who suggests Pam would be better suited, while Michael thinks Ryan should get it. Michael calls a meeting with Pam after meeting with Ryan to inform her she did not get the sales job. Pam is visibly disappointed, but Michael starts laughing and tells her that she did get it, having offered Ryan a temp position again. Pam laughs it off and tells him he should stop with the \"fake-firing\" joke. Michael then decides to pull the joke on the new receptionist, Erin Hannon."

He tells them that the next one to pull a prank will lose their Christmas bonus, and the target of the prank will get the prankster's share. Unfortunately, Andy's plan backfires, as both Dwight and Jim attempt to frame the other. Jim loudly releases his credit card information hoping Dwight will steal it and buy something ridiculous. However, Dwight orders a $200 dollar bouquet of flowers for Pam. Dwight then proceeds to put a porcupine in his desk and blame Jim. However, a verbal slip-up causes him to inadvertently reveal his intentions. Jim, in retaliation, defaces a picture of his daughter, Cece, and blames Dwight. After Andy mentions that defacing a picture is a fireable offense, Jim admits he staged the crime. Andy admits to Jim that he's nixing the bonus-loss plan, he just wants their behavior to not interfere with their job performances. Jim promises Andy to tone the jokes down and tells him he will tell Dwight. Dwight continues to deface his own property, writing \"Jim is awesome\" on his car and \"Idiot\" on his forehead. Jim, smirking, tells the camera that he needed to tell Dwight something, but can't quite remember."

Pam sees an upset Michael leave the party and follows him outside to tell him about the ultimatum, and points out that it means Holly and A.J.’s relationship probably won’t work out.

Toby sneakily suggests that they take a break from the session, play some games, and \"talk\" to pass the remaining 6 hours. Oddly enough, Michael lets his guard down and opens up to Toby about his childhood and relationships with people. Through listening to his history, Toby determines that Michael has an inherent need to be liked. Once he realizes what is happening, Michael ends the counseling session, and yells at Toby for duping him.

      "Michael explains in his talking head that it's Diversity Day and that a guest speaker is at Dunder Mifflin Scranton to talk about diversity in the workplace. Michael claims that he's wanted this for awhile. Corporate mandated it without Michael having to talk to them about it, though. But Michael still believes it's very important.",
      "Jim is trying to make a sales call when Dwight begins noisily shredding paper. Jim turns off Dwight's surge strip. In retaliation, Dwight disconnects Jim's phone call. Jim explains to the camera that this client makes up 25% of his commission each year. He brings a small bottle of champagne to the office with him to celebrate.",
      "While Pam plays freecell, Michael walks out of his office, then backs up when he sees the corporate representative is heading out of the conference room. He makes sure to walk out at the same time as the other man and make a point of singling out Oscar Martinez as a friend of his. Jim has made contact with his client just in time for Michael to order him into the meeting. Jim is forced to hang up again.",
      "When the meeting begins, Michael tries to take over by talking about how he doesn't even see Stanley as a black man. The representative explains that's not the point here. No one is expected to be color-blind. That's just fighting ignorance with more ignorance.",
      "Then Michael decides everyone should go around and name an ethnicity that he or she finds sexually attractive. Dwight claims he's attracted to whites and Indians. The representative does not think that's a good start. He asks Michael for permission to run this session himself and suggests it would be easier if Michael sits down.",
      "He explains that he asked each of them to write down an incident that offended them. He would like volunteers to assist him. Dwight asks that they don't do anything involving gays.",
      "The representative attempts to take control again from Michael who asks his name. When he reveals that it's Mr. Brown, Michael thinks it's a trick to see if he will call a black man Mr. Brown. Brown assures him that is his name. He goes on to explain that almost everyone wrote down the same incident and asks if everyone is familiar with the Chris Rock routine.",
      "Michael complains to the camera how Chris Rock can do a hilarious routine that makes everyone laugh, but he gets in trouble from corporate when he does the same routine. Michael volunteers to be the joker, Brown doesn't want the person who was the original offender in the same position. Kevin offers to be the joke teller, but doesn't tell it to Michael's liking. Michael interrupts with a loud, profane rendition of the routine before Brown stops him.",
      "While Jim listens to his phone ring, helpless to answer it, Brown sets up an acronym for Hero: Honesty, Empathy, Respect and Open-Mindedness. Dwight adds additional criteria that essentially describes a super-hero, not a hero. Brown passes out forms, asking everyone sign it. Michael refuses because he didn't learn anything.",
      "Privately, Brown explains that they both know he is here because of Michael's behavior. Michael argues that this office is racially advanced enough that it really doesn't need a diversity lecture. Brown tells him it does because it's Michael that caused the need for it. He only needs Michael's signature, but put the whole office through the seminar because he didn't want Michael to feel singled out. Michael feigns offense that this wasn't really about diversity then.",
      "Michael signs the form and then jokes after the fact that he signed it \"Daffy Duck\".",
      "In the meantime, Jim has tried to call back his client and has to leave a message.",
      "Michael comes out, tears up the pledge, and criticizes Mr. Brown's lack of an \"Oprah moment\". He wants everyone to get as much done before lunch as possible.",
      "Jim gets nothing but a busy signal right before Michael forces them all into the conference room again.",
      "The HR representative, Toby Flenderson asks if they are going to sit Indian style. Michael orders him out for being offensive. Then he shows the staff a video announcing his new initiative for Diversity Tomorrow and quotes Abraham Lincoln as saying, \"If you are a racist, I will attack you with the North\".",
      "Kelly Kapoor, a young Indian woman, asks to be excused for a customer meeting. Michael lets her go. He introduces himself and describes his ethnic breakdown, including that he is part Native American. Oscar asks him what part he is. Michael asks about Oscar's ethnicity. Oscar explains his parents were born in Mexico, moved here and he was born. Michael wants to know if there's something he would like to be called besides Mexican. Oscar doesn't understand why Michael would think Mexican is offensive.",
      "Jim, hearing his phone ring, runs out to grab it, but is too late.",
      "Michael hands out cards with different ethnicities on them. The employees are to take a card and then try to guess their pretend ethnicity by how their co-workers treat them.",
      "Stanley is inadvertently given Black. Dwight is Asian but can't guess it based upon people telling him they like his people's food or eat lots of rice. Michael, who's chosen Martin Luther King for himself, insists Pam stir up the pot by getting extreme. Pam hesitantly suggests to Dwight that his people aren't very good drivers. Dwight angrily asks if he's a woman.",
      "Jim goes to Pam's desk where Ryan is watching an online sketch. Ryan mentions how cute she is. Jim agrees, but that Pam is engaged. Ryan says he was talking about the girl in the sketch.",
      "Kevin is Italian and is trying to get Angela to guess that she's Jamaican by using the word \"mon\" and talking about beaches. Angela won't go any further when he asks if she wants to get high.",
      "Irritated that no one is trying very hard to be offensive, Michael immediately jumps on Kelly when she returns from her meeting by throwing himself into a really offensive Indian stereotype until Kelly slaps him. Michael gets visibly upset. He tells the employees how now Kelly knows what it's like to be a minority.",
      "Jim finally gets ahold of his client who was able to close his sale with Dwight instead who gave him a discount. Jim puts the mini champagne bottle on Dwight's desk.",
      "Michael continues mumbling about Mr. Brown and corrects Stanley on how to pronounce the word collard in collard greens. When 5 PM arrives, Pam is asleep on Jim's shoulder. He smiles at the camera, then wakes her up so they can go.",
      "He tells the camera that today was a pretty good day."

      "Kelly invites the entire staff to a celebration of Diwali, the Hindu Festival of Lights. Michael serves as the vocal supporter of such an event and believes it to be an Indian version of Halloween.",
      "A staff meeting is scheduled to enlighten staff members about Hindu culture. This is met with disgusted replies by Angela, excitement by Kevin (particularly after seeing illustrations in a kama sutra booklet distributed by Michael) and an uncomfortable Toby, who decides to end the meeting and takes away the booklets.",
      "Back in Stamford, Jim has decided to follow Josh's example and ride his bike to work. Andy pulls out a bottle of Jägermeister and shot glasses to turn a late night of work into a drinking game, which Karen wins by pouring her shots into her wastebasket while the two men continue to down shots.",
      "Michael and Carol arrive at the Diwali festival in costume since Michael thought the celebration would be a \"costume party.\" Carol is a cheerleader and Michael is wearing his papier-mâché twin from Halloween 2005, which he quickly removes.",
      "Ryan, dressed in a kurta (traditional men's Indian attire), tries to acquaint himself with Kelly's family, which is met with giggling by Kelly's younger sisters, whom Ryan believes compared his looks to Zach Braff in their language (they say \"Kelly likes Zach Braff... \" in Hindi). and disapproval by Kelly's parents, who want to set her up with an Indian doctor. This only gets worse when Ryan speaks with her parents about his promotion at Dunder Mifflin and his plans to save money for travel and an Xbox. Dwight gets into the spirit of the festival and dons a red Kurta. Even Michael is shown dancing happily to the music.",
      "Initially reluctant to attend the festival, Pam decides to go and actually enjoys herself as she starts dancing along with the staff and the rest of the festivalgoers. A cleaned up Roy shows up in time to find Pam in the middle of the dancing crowd, with another man too, making him uncomfortable, and he silently exits the party.",
      "Michael has an enlightening conversation with Kelly's parents about Hindu marriage customs and suddenly interrupts the celebration to publicly propose to Carol. Uncomfortable, Carol declines his offer and leaves the room. Michael follows her out to the car, where they briefly talk; Carol citing that this is only their ninth date, while Michael states how much he likes her. Carol drives home, leaving Michael to find a ride.",
      "Pam is surprised to find herself inspired by Michael's outgoing, romantic nature and she sends a text message to Jim. However, Jim is passed out on his desk and is unaware of the incoming message on his cell phone. As the Diwali festival winds down, a dejected Michael makes an attempt to kiss a disappointed Pam, who stops him and reluctantly agrees to drive him home, as long as he sits in the back seat. On the drive, he mentions the shoes he's wearing aren't his own.",
      "Back in Stamford, Karen leaves for the night, as Jim continues to lie face down on his desk and Andy is laid out on the floor, both completely inebriated. Jim asks Andy if he can get a ride but Andy says \"No way, dude,\" and begins to unfurl an inflatable mattress. He offers to share the \"roomy twin\" with Jim. Jim decides to ride his bike home but barely exits the front door when he crashes sideways into the bushes. An amused Karen laughs and offers Jim a ride home. He accepts immediately and crawls into her backseat leaving her to deal with his bicycle.",
      "Sometime during the party, Michael took the stage with Dwight behind him on guitar. Beginning by saying \"this is going out to Indians everywhere,\" he began a song as a tribute to \"one of the greats\" Mr. Adam Sandler. The lyrics are: \"Diwali is a festival of lights, let me tell you something, tonight has been.. one crazy night, so put on your saris, it's time to celebrate Diwali, everybody looks so jolly, but it's not Christmas, it's Diwali, the goddess of destruction Kali, stopped by to celebrate Diwali, don't invite any zombies, to our celebration of Diwali, along came Polly, to have some fun at Diwali, if you're Indian and you love to party, have a happy, happy, happy, happy Diwali.\" He then wished everybody a Happy Diwali and the crowd cheered."

After only one day, however, the group manages to make five mistakes, and Dwight reveals that the emails will be automatically sent to Robert at 5:00 pm.

After complimenting Dwight numerous times and having a small meal, Pam makes a joke that emphasizes that everyone is human and makes mistakes. Dwight, after hearing this, deactivates the machine after the party leaves Schrute Farms. Jim is tasked with tracking down Robert at a squash court and intercepting the doomsday emails before Robert has a chance to view them. To distract him, Jim plays several games, demonstrating his complete lack of skill at squash. Eventually, he discovers that the email has not come through, and prepares to leave, but Robert makes him stay and continue playing.",

He dresses up as the traditional winter Christmas gift-bringer figure Belsnickel, cooks Dutch food, and plays a game called \"Impish or Admirable\". Jim, however, has to leave the party early to arrive in Philadelphia for his sports marketing job; this causes Dwight to be visibly saddened. Dwight ends the festivities, and a \"normal\" Christmas party is started. Although Pam tries to cheer him up, only Jim's sudden return makes him feel better. During the party, Darryl fears that Jim has forgotten to include him in the new job in Philadelphia. As such, he gets extremely drunk. When he goes to confront Jim, Jim—unknowing that Darryl was upset—excitedly tells him that he has arranged an interview for him. Darryl, appeased, turns around but passes out and crashes down on the catering table.",

Andy, who is still away in the Caribbean after sailing his family's boat, emails Erin and says that he thinks he is going to stay for a few weeks. Hurt, Erin decides to watch Die Hard with Pete rather than just hear him quote it. While watching the movie, Erin begins to cry and Pete tries to comfort her by placing his arm around her. Although Erin notes that she is still dating Andy, she tells Pete that he can continue putting his arm around her. In the meantime, Toby tells Nellie about the Scranton Strangler case he was on. After boring her for what is implied to be several hours, she hushes him, before gently kissing him. Toby then whips off his glasses and kisses her back."

Dwight establishes a strict management style, from making the employees say The Pledge of Allegiance, to setting up firewalls and long passwords to use the office's various machines, and installing antique punch clocks. Jim, who had turned down the temporary manager position believing that they should not be assigned one at all, is especially unhappy with the changes, and begins pranking Dwight by suggesting that he is leading an uprising called \"The Fist\". In order to impress Jo, Dwight buys a gun, though he is more excited when he receives a holster as a gift from a relative, and uses the gun to accessorize. Pam insists that he put it away, but Dwight accidentally fires the gun right by Andy, causing him temporary hearing loss. He attempts to bribe the office workers into silence with various favors, and Jim insists that Dwight do outlandish things (such as saying, \"Shagedelic, baby!\") at certain promptings.",

When asked whether or not he wants to date Erin, he does not give a straight answer, and eventually claims that it is between him and his diary.",
      "When Jo comes to visit the branch, Dwight admits to the gun incident. He attempts to divert the blame to his employees, saying that blackmail is a bigger crime than firing a gun accidentally, but Jo takes the position away from him. Jo later puts Creed, who has the most experience and seniority in the office, in charge until a committee composed of Jim, Toby, and Gabe, find a replacement. While Jim tells Dwight that Jo did the right thing, he also compliments Dwight, noting that the office got every single company order out on time when he was in charge."

Holly catches onto the idea when she calls her parents herself, but she notices her dad seeming somewhat mentally disoriented. She talks to Michael later and says she wants to move back to Colorado to be there for her dad whom she is worried about, and Michael supports her decision. She tries proposing to Michael herself, but Michael quickly ends the conversation before she can ask him, since he wants to propose and not be proposed to.

One item on Jim and Pam's table that piques his interest is a packet of \"miracle legumes.\" Dwight initially believes that they contain no magic, but is astonished when they reappear after Jim had seemingly destroyed the packet. Eventually, his curiosity gets the better of him and he trades Jim a telescope for the legumes. At the end of the episode, Dwight is seen planting the seeds and Jim secretly replaces the empty pots with full-grown plants. Andy, Darryl, and Kevin play and bet on the Dallas board game (which Kevin had for sale). As the instruction booklet is not with the game, Andy and Darryl make up the rules as they go along, much to Kevin's objection. Eventually, Kevin notices the money they had bet on the game with is missing, and storms out. As Darryl and Andy look at each other in confusion, Kevin reveals to the cameras that he has the money, stating, \"And that... is Dallas\", mocking Andy and Darryl's previous statement."

Andy is noticeably jealous at the amount of attention his younger brother Walter Bernard, Jr. receives from his father, and he thinks that by throwing an elaborate party he can ensure his father's blessings. At first, the party goes along smoothly. Andy decides to make a toast to his fellow employees in hopes that they will toast him in return, as if to show his parents and California that he is a respected individual among his employees. His plan backfires, however, and instead many people end up praising Robert. To get everybody's mind off of Robert, Andy decides to sing \"More Than Words\" as a duet with his father. This too goes awry as his visibly-annoyed father corrects his playing and singing, and ultimately decides to sing a duet with Walter Jr. instead of Andy. Visibly upset, Andy stops their singing and storms off.",
      "Soon thereafter, Andy is confronted by his father for his \"obnoxious attitude\", which he turns into a browbeating on Andy as \"manager of some rinky dink branch\". This conversation is overheard by the other staff on the baby monitor Jim and Pam brought for their daughter, and Pam quickly turns off the monitor to let Andy save face. Darryl and Oscar later confide to the camera that they now understand why Andy feels he needs to prove himself to everyone. After his family leaves, a dejected Andy, feeling unwanted by his family and co-workers, says goodbye to the office staff as they turn the garden party into a barbecue. Darryl and Oscar, however, manage to convince Andy to stay with a cheeseburger and a beer, and they all satisfyingly watch as Dwight performs the closing ceremonies to the garden party.",
      "Dwight works to make the garden party a classy event. Dwight thoroughly reads a book called The Ultimate Guide to Throwing a Garden Party that he'd bought online, thinking it was a great buy. However, the book is revealed to be an elaborate prank, secretly written by Jim under the pseudonym \"James Trickington\". The book gives outlandish advice such as announcing each guest's name as they arrive in an extremely loud manner among other absurd \"duties\" (imitating The Last Supper in the middle of a meal, randomly dancing with his party staff, etc.). Near the end of the episode, Andy and the staff look on in delight as Dwight and his workers perform a fire court dance (as part of the Trickington book) as a closing ceremonies. The episode then ends with footage of Jim abusing Dwight's announcing duties by walking past him and then walking back again, prompting Dwight to shout his name each time he does so.",

Pam and Angela learn they've both chosen the name Phillip for their soon-to-be-born sons, with Pam choosing to name her child after her deceased grandfather and Angela after the name of her favorite cat. Angela, visibly annoyed that Pam doesn't relinquish the name right away, later makes a toast to \"my son Phillip\" at the garden party—only to have Pam make the same toast but describe in great detail how the name honors her now-dead grandfather. Angela, unwilling to reveal her feline-centric reasons for the name, grouses to the camera that Pam is always copying her."

Believing the hug insufficient, Michael tells the staff to \"watch this, and burn this into your brains\", and kisses a struggling, reluctant Oscar on the mouth. Dwight, who was seemingly moved by Michael's actions, consequently attempts to kiss Oscar. In interviews, Dwight says he now believes Michael is gay.

During the Civil War, Schrute Farms was a safe haven for artists and poets (and, as heavily implied, homosexuals). Oscar finds this fascinating, whereas Dwight leaves in disgust.",

      "Michael is seen making offensive jokes around the office but is later insulted himself by a joke made by Dwight regarding the KGB. After banning \"knock knock\" jokes, Jim changes the joke from \"knock knock\" to \"ding dong\", intriguing Michael. Jim responds that the KGB is again waiting, only to have Michael and Dwight fight over who gets the door. Eventually, Jim slaps Dwight the same way Dwight had slapped Michael as a part of the joke.",
      "Michael comes to work dressed up and starts to impersonate Willy Wonka, after being \"inspired\" by an idea that is sure to bring up paper sales. His idea is to place golden tickets in shipments of paper for the customers to be eligible for a 10% discount for a year. In addition to his excitement, Michael also holds a \"marketing conference\" in the office. However, his idea backfires, as the company's largest client, Blue Cross of Pennsylvania, receives a ticket and Oscar claims that a 10% discount given to Blue Cross is harmful to the company. The news worsens when the health insurance company receives all the golden tickets, making them eligible for 50% off on all paper purchases. To make matters worse, it is revealed that Michael had completely forgotten to note \"limit one per customer\". Michael, at first, berates Darryl for not properly labeling the shipments for the customers, although Darryl made it clear that Michael had to know that shipments close to each other meant they were headed to the same customer. Embarrassed, Michael disposes of his Willy Wonka attire and returns with Andy's blazer, and starts a conference to get the branch out of the problem.",
      "However, all the employees are disgruntled and are also furious for reasons of their own, such as Jim blaming Michael for his losing 1/2 of his commission while he has to pay a mortgage for his parents' home. Soon Michael receives a call from CEO David Wallace, who is also furious and demands an explanation on the perpetrator responsible for the idea and why the idea was approved. Michael, not admitting that it was his idea, claims it was an \"inside job\" and blames it on one of the employees: Dwight. Soon, Dwight is seen talking with Michael, fighting over who was responsible for the idea, which Dwight clearly explains was Michael's fault, with the help of his diary.",
      "Later, Dwight and Michael are seen walking around, discussing loyalty and what Dunder Mifflin had offered Dwight. Michael also explains that true loyalty is to take the blame from Wallace and risk losing his job. Dwight considers accommodating Michael but has not made his mind up when Jim tries to talk him into letting Michael take responsibility for his actions. When Wallace comes in Michael, expecting Dwight to get fired, anxiously asks Dwight to take the blame for the golden ticket idea. Michael is appalled when Wallace tells them that due to the golden ticket idea, Blue Cross is making Dunder Mifflin its exclusive office supply provider. Dwight, having risked losing his job when the golden tickets were a bad idea, takes the credit as the office cheers 'his' great idea. Wallace wants Dwight to talk to the Marketing department and as the telephone conference begins, Michael listens in then busts into the conference room to claim the credit. Michael becomes furious and complains that it was his idea and fights with Dwight to take credit. However, Wallace, unable to believe that Michael wants credit after having blamed a subordinate, becomes annoyed and leaves prematurely. Dwight and Michael later discuss to the camera about whose idea it was in their own words and begin to fight over Dwight's diary. In the end, Dwight also continues his KGB joke with Jim, only to be stood up after Jim states \"I'm taking a shower, can you come back later?\"",

As the three begin to fight over what is true and whose idea is more practical, a frustrated Kevin decides to take matters into his own hands. Kevin asks Lynn out in his own method and is successful."

However, he doesn't reveal that it is his real last goodbye, so he uses one his characters, Ping, to say goodbye to the office. Jim realizes what is happening and asks to talk to Michael in private. Michael reveals that he is leaving in a few minutes. Jim promises not to tell anyone that he is leaving. Jim expresses his true feelings for Michael, telling him that he turned out to be a great boss. With this goodbye, Michael leaves the office, but not before taking the almost finished mittens that Phyllis made for him. Pam is the only person Michael was not able to say goodbye to. Pam arrives back at the office just after Michael leaves. However, Pam rushes to the airport, saying an emotional goodbye right before Michael leaves for Colorado.",

Michael succeeds in warming up to Holly with less-obnoxious small talk and jokes. Michael even tempers Toby's exit interview, which he originally planned to be brutal and insulting, when Holly attends. When Michael's cruel going-away present (a rock with the words \"Suck On This\") is revealed, Pam cons Michael into giving Toby his sports watch. Dwight continues the hazing, telling Holly that Kevin is mentally challenged and putting a raccoon in her car. When Michael chastises him in front of everyone, Holly is even more receptive.

Shortly afterwards, the staff finds a video on YouTube of Ryan being arrested for fraud (though while describing what he'd done in a talking head, Oscar jokes that Ryan's attempt at a beard was his \"real\" crime). Michael is greatly concerned for his \"friend\" Ryan, but Jim takes pleasure in the video and leaves Ryan a second voicemail telling him to disregard the last message \"since [his] hands are tied.\"",

So far, he has been putting it off hoping someone would quit, move, or die so he wouldn't have to do it. Of course, he has no idea who he is going to let go. Michael goes to the Accounting Department (Kevin, Angela, and Oscar) and asks them to find $50,000 in the budget (basically, a salary and benefits), who come to the conclusion that the Accounting Department has three people doing the work of two, but don't tell Michael. Dwight gets on Jim's nerves so he and Pam decide to post Dwight's resume on the web. Angela gets mad at Pam for bringing brownies instead of chips and dip to the office party. Dwight's resume gets a hit from a company in Maryland, so Jim plays Michael and gives Dwight a great reference. When the company, Cumberland Mills, calls Dwight to set up an interview, Dwight immediately ruins his chances by having a rather stern argument with the caller over the importance and relevance of martial arts.",
      "Pam thinks Jim should be the one to be getting better job offers and mentions to Jim that, given the salary and growth potential there, he should apply for the Cumberland Mills job. Jim is clearly hurt by the suggestion, thinking that perhaps Pam wouldn't care if he left. Pam tries to back-pedal but Jim makes clear his feelings. Michael tries to practice his firing skills with Jim, but doesn't fire him. Michael decides to fire Creed, after unsuccessfully trying to fire Pam and Stanley. Creed is unwilling to be fired so he talks Michael into letting Devon go, which he does. Devon retailiates by smashing a pumpkin on Michael's car. As Jim is leaving to go home, Pam apologises for pushing him into taking the Cumberland job and reassures him that she would 'blow her brains out' if he ever left. In a talking head, Jim brushes off the remark, saying that if Pam were the one leaving, he wouldn't necessarily blow his brains out...though he would take the Cumberland Mills job. At the end of the episode, we see a guilty Michael alone at home on Halloween, handing out candy to trick-or-treaters."

      "Michael completes his 25th push-up and one girl push-up and challenges the office employees to do 26 push-ups of their own. Those who do can go home. While Angela, Jim, and the rest of the office try and fail, the office cheers on Stanley, who remains dedicated to the task. Oscar states that it is remarkable, however, Michael says that it is unfair because his weight is pushing him down to the floor. Stanley completes the goal, and the office yells in excitement for him. Stanley leaves.",
      "Oscar comes in early to encounter Matt, and says that he is always early, but Calvin tells Matt he never comes in early. When Oscar tries the door he realizes that the office won't open for two hours. Oscar suggests to Darryl that everyone go to happy hour. Darryl says that he'll invite Matt and then makes a pun: he tells Oscar that he knows about his liking Matt and says that he can be gay with Matt but be straight with him. Oscar then asks the office if they would like to go to happy hour and Phyllis agrees. She says she likes to wear something low-cut, because when someone flirts with her, Bob Vance beats them up. The documentary crew is shocked, but Phyllis only remarks, \"What?\" Jim says that he can not go because the baby is with Pam and she wouldn't want to leave the baby. When Jim calls Pam, to ask her if she wants to go to happy hour, she is ecstatic and begs to go, yelling that she could be around adults and desperately misses everyone.",
      "Erin and Andy try to keep their relationship under wraps, quiet and free of drama. Erin pretends to hate Andy, but they both agree to go to happy hour together. Kevin suspects their relationship quickly and starts to make crude gestures while the couple are in a talking head, which Andy and Erin find pretty funny.",
      "Michael also decides to go to happy hour. Everyone from the office arrives at happy hour, and Pam invites her friends, Isabel and Julie; she plans to set up Michael with Julie. Pam sees Kevin, who is trying to get Pam's breasts to leak by crying like a baby. Michael meets Julie, and they hit it off. Isabel comes and flirts with Dwight, who is talking to Angela at the time. Angela notices Dwight's interest in Isabel and starts to become jealous. Julie says that she likes Michael, however things take a turn for the worse when Jim alerts Michael that he is on a date. Michael then becomes \"Date Mike.\"  While Hide talks to Oscar, Michael starts to act boorish and outlandish. Kevin continues his quest to make Pam's breasts leak. Kelly and Ryan play Dance Dance Revolution. Erin and Andy want to play it, but decide that playing together would make people aware of their relationship. While Isabel and Dwight talk and flirt with each other, Angela follows them, leading him to get closer to Isabel while they play whac-a-mole. Michael continues to be obnoxious and the date gets worse. Later, Andy gets signals that people know about his relationship with Erin, and he says that he doesn't want the drama.",
      "Dwight tells Angela that they had a good run, but that it's over; he offers to release her from their contract. Michael continues to act irrational and starts to dance on the pool table. When the bar manager, Donna, sees Michael, she calls security and asks him to stop, which he does. Michael goes up to Donna and they fight, however, they soon begin to flirt. Erin and Andy flirt with different people, but when Erin gropes someone, trying to be like people from the movies, Andy tells her to stop and yells at her in the picture booth. Julie decides to leave, and Pam tells her that Michael is not always like this, but can't tell her what he is really like. Donna asks Michael when he is coming back to the bar.",
      "Darryl tells Oscar that Matt is dumb, and Oscar momentarily agrees, but as soon as Matt shows up he eagerly goes with him to play hoops. Looking at the pictures of his yelling at Erin, Andy realizes that his and Erin's relationship is becoming dysfunctional. Not wanting a relationship like that, he goes to the microphone and announces to everyone that they are dating. Then he admits he likes the drama anyway. Angela confronts Dwight and Isabel. Isabel 'whacks' Angela lightly, when Angela says that she is taking Dwight to court. Isabel and Dwight then make out. Michael says that he and a woman hit it off. Jim and Pam, thinking he meant Julie, obviously disagree. Michael says that his success with women is due to Date Mike. A drunk Kelly starts to cry when Erin spills her drink, and she and Ryan decide to go home. Kelly's crying starts Pam's breasts leaking, to Kevin's delight.",

      "Michael and Dwight have been having secret meetings in the parking lot, where Dwight provides information about Dunder Mifflin so Michael can undercut the company. However, Dwight's loyalty is put to the test as Charles Miner seems to show more respect for Dwight than Michael did. Dwight brings Charles to the parking lot during one of the secret meetings, where Charles orders Michael to stop pestering Dwight. This begins a rivalry between Michael and Dwight, and Michael begins to steal Dwight's clients. Dwight asks for a truce and offers to take Michael and his employees out to lunch; Dwight does not go to the restaurant and instead sneaks into the empty Michael Scott Paper Company office and steals everything on Michael's desk, including his Rolodex contact list, and places a dead fish in the air conditioning vent.",
      "Jim and Pam are attempting to get bargain deals on wedding plans from Andy. When Pam turns down his ideas, Andy suspects that Pam might be acting controlling and cruelly to Jim, in the same way Angela treated Andy. Andy warns Jim, who tries to convince Andy that he and Pam are really happy. Andy remains convinced that Pam will betray him, so Jim asks Andy to provide for his emotional needs as a prank. After Jim feigns crying on Andy's shoulder, Andy blames the office for Jim's emotional troubles and asks them to apologize. Phyllis tells Andy that Jim is just messing with him. Andy does not believe her until he sees Jim grinning through the kitchen window. When Andy confronts Jim, Jim assures him that he and Pam are really happy and that Andy will find someone else one day.",

Michael calls Dwight on the phone and tells him that he is going to steal his biggest client while he listens. Dwight races to the Harper Collins office, where Michael and Dwight start fighting over the client. The client asks for both of their offers via email, and they agree to do so. Before leaving, Dwight then looks at the client's personal information from Michael's Rolodex card and asks him about his \"gay son\", which seemingly perturbs the client. Michael reveals his unusual system where he color codes personal information about his contacts so he knows what not to talk about. Michael is seen laughing with the client in the parking lot as Dwight returns to his car alone."

      "At Dunder Mifflin Stamford, Karen is disturbed to find her chair squeaks and accuses Jim of a chair swap. He protests that he simply switched them back after she made the original switch. Karen promises to switch chairs while he's away from his desk, so he vows not to stand and proves such by rolling to the copy machine.",

Pam asks Michael to use his time in line to authorize some checks, but he instead has her hold his place in line while he uses the restroom. She offers to brings him a pretzel if Michael returns to the office, but he explains that if she ordered his pretzel incorrectly \"then ... this whole thing's blown.\" Shown to the camera, the productivity log now reads \"Stood in Pretzel line\" for the noon hour.",
      "Angry Ryan walks alone up a dirt road, muttering to himself. He knocks on a barn door, and Dwight jumps out: \"Congratulations, resourceful salesman! Welcome to Schrute Farm!\" Dwight then gives him his signature salute.

In an interview, Andy completes the song's chorus — \"I don't care 'bout anything but you\" — and ponders the whereabouts of the band. Eventually the squeaky chair gets passed to Andy when he isn't in the room.",

In retaliation, Ryan begins to throw Mose's eggs at the building and CEO reserved parking sign. Surprised at Ryan's initiative, Dwight joins him, shouting \"Oh no, no, no,\" until two security guards saunter out, at which point the pair peel out of the parking lot in Dwight's Firebird. They go to a bar and drink boilermakers, and as a result of the day's events, Dwight no longer calls Ryan \"Temp\" but instead uses his given name.",

Having forgotten Kevin's phone extension, Jim calls Dunder Mifflin's main number, hoping to leave him a voicemail regarding a fantasy football issue. Pam answers and says she's staying late because of her new assignment to chronicle Michael's work day, a copy of which she promises to send to Jim. The pair enjoy a long chat about her tiny apartment and her scary solo movie night in which she rented 28 Days Later rather than 28 Days. They start to reconnect, but Ryan and Dwight, both exhausted, return to the office for a few seconds and she loudly says goodbye to the pair as they exit.

He then gets mad that the student signed his name on the sheet of paper and tells Pam to put out another.

      "Dunder Mifflin CEO David Wallace has tasked Dwight with finding a part-time replacement for Jim. Clark feels he is ready for the position after 12 grueling weeks of work at Dunder Mifflin, but Dwight makes it clear he doesn't want Clark to get the job. Instead, he brings in a bizarre gallery of his relatives and close friends, including his cousin Mose, best friend Rolf, part-time private investigator Trevor, former Corporate executive Troy, karate teacher Sensei Ira, and a few others.",
      "Pam and Jim are both concerned about Dwight's ideas, as Pam is worried about who will take over Jim's desk and Jim feels guilty that his work in Philadelphia will leave Pam at the mercy of Dwight's questionable judgment. It quickly becomes apparent, though, that none of Dwight's candidates are remotely qualified to be paper salesmen, and while Dwight dismisses Clark again after he aces his interview, he is too committed to making a good hire to actually give the job to someone like Mose, Rolf or Trevor.",
      "Dwight gets a few cheap shots in at Jim's expense when Jim makes a phone call to Wallace in hopes of getting the CEO to invest in Athlead. Jim is forced to have the conversation on speaker phone, and gets double-punched when Wallace first says that Jim's salary is going to be cut to reflect his part-time status, and then bluntly shoots down the idea of putting any money towards Athlead.",
      "Dwight is stuck between not being able to honestly hire any of his friends and being afraid they will hate him if he doesn't just pick one of them. He tries to get Jim to take over for him, and Jim refuses, but they agree to a plan where Jim will let everyone down easy by claiming he made the call to hire no one.",
      "Unfortunately, Dwight completely overplays his \"anger\" at Jim for not hiring them, and Rolf and everyone else immediately realize Dwight lied to them and wasted their time. They elect to play paintball without him, later sending a rude e-mail that says \"Glad you're not here\", and Dwight sadly notes that he lost all of his friends in just three hours. Clark does get the salesman job, and Pam briefly lifts Dwight's spirits by suggesting they \"haze the new guy\", though she makes Dwight stop that plan when he nearly suffocates Clark with shrink wrap. It is also hinted at that Brian, the boom mike operator for the documentary crew, has developed a crush on Pam."

    "storylines": [
      "Starting the episode, Andy goes down to the warehouse and asks Val if he could have the area to himself. He compares stress to a mayor who decrees it is illegal to dance—as in the plot of Footloose—and relieves his stress by dancing and making a mess in the warehouse. Andy later adds that sex is also a viable option to relieve stress.",
      "Jim returns from jury duty and learns that, in his absence, many of his co-workers were forced to make up for his vacancy, often suffering setbacks and inconveniences in the process. Jim reveals to the camera that, while he was called for duty, he was dismissed at noon and headed home to Pam and their two children; he saw that Pam was overwhelmed and took the rest of the week off to help take care of their children. After \"reenacting\" the crime for his interested co-workers, Dwight begins to question Jim on every detail of his case. Dwight goes to great lengths to try and get Jim to reveal the truth, and figures out Jim was lying about jury duty. Ashamed, Jim admits his guilt to Andy who, although upset, understands Jim's plight. He, therefore, agrees to help Jim cover up his story by telling the now-suspicious office workers that he drove Jim to the courthouse every morning, a ridiculous lie because Andy lives near the courthouse but a long way from Jim and Pam's home.",
      "Soon, Jim and Andy begin disagreeing whether they should continue the charade or admit the truth. Jim eventually does the latter, much to the chagrin of his fellow co-workers. Dwight is thrilled at the confession because Andy had said earlier he would fire Jim if he had lied about his absence, but Andy says he will not fire Jim, and instead gives him a mild-looking slap to the face as punishment. Dwight furiously calls up Gabe so he can turn Jim in and \"the office stickler will do what he does best...stickle!\" To smooth things over, Jim and Pam bring in their children, Cece and Phillip, to present pictures that they drew for the co-workers. It becomes clear that Jim and Pam drew the pictures themselves to appease their co-workers, but before the members of the office can berate the couple, Cece and Phillip simultaneously begin crying loudly, creating a cacophony that Jim and Pam struggle to control, and which shocks the office workers. Realizing the stress that having young children causes, the office workers, ultimately, do not blame Jim for his behavior and even suggest he leave early to help Pam.",
      "Angela and her husband, state senator Robert Lipton, welcome their new baby, also named Phillip. Oscar, Kevin, Erin, and Gabe all visit Angela at the hospital. According to Angela, the baby was born prematurely, but due to the size, Oscar correctly deduces that Angela lied about the date of conception. Angela admits that the baby was conceived a month before her wedding, but makes him promise not to tell anyone. Oscar later breaks his promise to Dwight, who barges in on Angela and her husband and begins thoroughly examining the child. When the senator leaves, Dwight confronts Angela about the child, claiming that it is his. She refutes his claim, but Dwight leaves satisfied, telling the attending nurse to call off the baby's circumcision, which the nonplussed nurse refuses to do. Upon returning to Dunder Mifflin he drops his dispute with Jim, since his self-assumed fatherhood has given him a new appreciation for the duties of parenthood. The episode ends with Dwight putting a decal on his car, in honor of his covert new family member."

But in a talking head interview, Jim reveals that they're actually watching the television screen next to Michael, which is showing a DVD screensaver logo bouncing around. They are intently watching to see if the logo ever bounces directly into the corner of the screen, and their audible reactions (which Michael misinterprets as responses to the things he's saying) come as the logo just misses. Eventually the logo does bounce into the corner, and everyone erupts in celebration.

Michael returns to Scranton dejected and attempts to plan a better party. This irritates party planner Angela, who has already been in an exceptionally irritable mood.  Michael's attempt to create a better party in Scranton hits an early snag when he accidentally orders pizza from the office's least favorite pizzeria. Michael finally snaps when the delivery boy refuses to honor an ambiguous coupon. Michael then refuses to let the surly youngster leave unless he changes his mind about the discount. The other employees order new pizzas from their preferred establishment, and the party goes on even while Michael's kidnapping victim sits next to them. Jim and Pam escape to the rooftop with one of the pizzas, both to be by themselves and to avoid being associated with the delivery boy's detention.",

Eventually Michael has an epiphany about the fact that he's committed a crime, and lets the delivery boy go after Dwight pays full price for the pizzas.",

When Karen comes to greet them, the two are shocked to see that she is pregnant. Michael immediately asks if it is Jim's, which Karen denies. Michael's lecture to the Utica branch is a failure and Karen brings Michael and Pam into her office. While Michael fools around, Karen reveals to Pam she is due in one month and is married to a dermatologist named Dan. Pam mentions that she and Jim are engaged, about which Karen hesitantly but happily congratulates her. On the way to the car, Pam mentions to Michael that she is happy she came on the trip because she found closure with Karen.

Pam explains that Jim has been spending a few days a week in Philadelphia working on his new company and that she has been taking care of the kids. She also explains that Cece recently got lice and she was awake all night disinfecting everything in the house.",
      "Jim is in Philadelphia and is very excited as he is about to meet Julius Erving, also known as Dr. J, a famous former NBA player. He doesn't tell any of this to Pam on the phone as he feels it would just stress her out to know he is having fun while she is working.",
      "Darryl and Val have just broken up. While he is with Val, Darryl appears to be quite saddened by the breakup, but during his interview he reveals that he manipulated Val into breaking up with him because their relationship wasn't going anywhere and he wanted his freedom if he was going to be working at Jim's company in Philadelphia.",
      "When Pam asks Meredith to fill out a form she notices Meredith furiously scratching her head and worries that she might have brought lice into the office. Erin notices Meredith scratching and, after searching her scalp, she confirms that Meredith has lice, having become familiar with lice while in a foster home. Erin then proceeds to check everyone in the office and finds everyone infected except Dwight, Phyllis, Nellie, Kevin, and Darryl. Pam looks furtively at the camera but continues with the deception, not revealing that she is really to blame for the lice.",

They go with the mayonnaise plan, and Pam makes a trip to the store for it. When she gets back to the office and starts unloading her car, she calls Jim. He asks Dr. J if he can take the call from his wife and Dr. J encourages him to take it. They have a short conversation during which Pam drops two jars of mayonnaise on the ground and they spill everywhere.",

      "While putting mayo in Oscar's hair, Angela becomes subtly aggressive: slapping him in the face while putting on the mayo, letting excess mayonnaise run down his face and neck, and hitting him in the head with a coffee pot while rinsing out the water. In the annex Pete and Erin have fun together as they put on their mayonnaise, laughing and imitating different characters, and after Creed abandons Pam she is forced to put it on by herself.",

      "Back in the office Dwight announces that he has bought a \"insecticidal grenade\" which he plans to detonate in the office, but as he is talking to the group he drops it and the bomb goes off around him. Dwight then tells the office that the exploded bomb seems to have hallucinogenic effects and after speaking nonsensically he faints.",
      "As Erin readies herself to rinse the mayo off of Pete's head he removes his shirt, revealing a toned body beneath his undershirt, and draws Erin's attention, although she looks quickly away. She begins washing the mayonnaise out of his hair affectionately and asks if it's too cold. He says no and they both give a small smile.",
      "When Pam is spreading mayonnaise into her hair by herself she receives a phone call and, as her hands are covered in mayo, she is unable to answer it and puts the phone on speaker instead. On the other end it is Helene who tells her that she has just picked up Cece after she was sent home from school because she still has lice. As the phone is on speaker everyone in the office hears the call and they furiously shout at Pam for bringing in the lice and letting Meredith take the blame. Meredith angrily demands Pam shave her head.",
      "When Pete stops by Erin's desk he finds it empty and Oscar tells him that she has already gone home for the day. Pete looks visibly saddened by the news, but Erin is actually standing by the supply shelves and sees his reaction. In the parking lot Dwight tells the camera he is ready to deal with lice and accidentally drops another lice bomb, which detonates in his car.",
      "Pam calls Jim again and leaves him a message as he does not see that she is calling him because he is busy playing basketball with Dr. J. Overhearing Pam's sad voicemail message for Jim, Meredith invites her out for a drink and Pam smiles and agrees, relieved. At the bar Pam admits she is impressed by Meredith's ability to have been a single mom all these years and the two look happy, the episode ending with Pam and Meredith singing karaoke at the bar and appearing to have a good time."

She tries to see him as much as she can by deliberately misinterpreting Charles as wanting her to come into his office every time he calls for the new receptionist, Kelly Hannon. Eventually, Charles tires of this and declares that he will call them by their last names instead. Kelly Hannon requests to be called Erin, her middle name. Kelly Kapoor then storms out.",
      "When Michael gives Ryan and Pam a paper to copy, Pam asks Ryan to do it as she doesn't want to be the receptionist anymore. Pam says she misses making copies. Ryan continues to be a lazy employee of the company, and talks to his friends on his phone. Ryan calls Pam a \"6 in New York and a 7 in Scranton\" based on her looks. Pam looks to the camera, disgusted.",
      "Andy and Dwight, once \"sexual competitors\" and enemies, become best friends and decide to go on a hunting trip. However, Dwight and Andy start to compete over Erin. Dwight plays a joke on Erin and talks to her. Andy briefly (and awkwardly) dances with Erin before she leaves the room. Dwight realizes that Andy is attracted to Erin, and admits that he is too. However, Andy and Dwight agree to not pursue a relationship with Erin, and instead continue to be friends.",
      "Charles asks Jim to create a “run-down” of his clients. Jim accepts the task, but doesn't know what a run-down is. He stalls, and asks Charles about a run-down and awkwardly talks to him. Hours later, still unknowing of what a run-down is, Jim asks Oscar and Kevin for help, but they are unaware as well. Charles asks Jim if he has started the run-down, but becomes angry when he discovers Jim is doing something else. When Jim finally brings the run-down to Charles, he is told to send it to everyone on the “distribution list”. Jim gives the run-down to his dad, still unknowing of what in fact, a run-down really is.",
      "Ryan spends his time watching videos on YouTube (specifically \"It's Just Like a Mini Mall\") . Pam and Ryan endlessly fight and Michael yells at them for fighting. Pam and Ryan remain bored and Pam yells at Ryan for putting a naked picture of Ryan's friend, Jasmine, on the computer. Ryan and Pam continue their feud. Michael has a talk with Pam and Ryan about disliking each other, and they talk about making a corner idea so that everyone can have a personal space. To Pam's sadness, her corner is the one with the copier.",

Michael starts his pancake luncheon with Pam trying to get clients and Ryan not doing anything. Creed and Meredith take pancakes from Michael, which they don't like.",

Andy and Dwight try to outdo the other in an attempt to impress her by playing it fast, by singing, and in Dwight's case singing in German. Erin looks shocked at how well they are playing and laughs. Erin, amused, leaves the break room, and continuing to play, Dwight and Andy are finally stopped by Toby Flenderson.",

At the rink, he also runs into his real estate agent Carol with her children and he entertains them, which puts a smile on Carol's face. Kevin gets the call about his results, which turn up negative, to everyone's relief except for Michael's who believes that negative meant he did have cancer. He later explains that \"Apparently, in the medicine community, negative means good, which makes absolutely no sense. In the real world community, ye-that would be... chaos.\" The gifts are passed out to Kevin and Michael and Pam expresses her feelings on the \"great day\"."

      "The episode opens with Michael and Deangelo personally delivering Dundies nomination plaques to the employees of Dunder Mifflin. At the office, Michael announces to the employees that Deangelo will be his co-host at the Dundies. The idea of performance is worrisome to Deangelo though, but Michael makes him take the job. Michael brings some of the staff together in the conference room to try and help Deangelo get prepared for the show, but Deangelo has problems riffing (even Ryan's pointers don't help him).",
      "Andy tries to help him, saying he should just think of performing like conducting a meeting, but Michael objects to that, saying Deangelo should perceive it as the performance of his life. Michael tries a number of different things to help Deangelo, such as sitting on his stomach, ordering him to tell him something traumatic that happened in his childhood, and making him listen to a Walkman with the music turned up all the way so he can't hear himself talk, but none are effective.",
      "Jim and Pam, coming from elsewhere, see Erin sitting in her car eating a sandwich. Afraid of being spotted, she brings them into the car to explain she's taken to eating lunch in her car to get some time away from Gabe, who she's starting to despise. Pam coaches Erin, saying if she doesn't love Gabe she should break things off with him, as to not lead him on any further. This amuses Jim, given Pam's history with Roy, and he leaves to avoid the temptation to comment on the irony of her advice. In a talking head interview, Jim claims the situation simply didn't interest him.",
      "A few hours after work, the employees arrive at Louie Volpe's (the restaurant the Dundies are being hosted at) and are treated to an opening video where Deangelo is searching for Michael to be his co-host, in which Michael plays various employees around the office. First, he's Jo Bennett. Then, he's Angela, which gets laughs, particularly from Oscar. Next, he's Jim, who he plays as sort of a stoner type character. He then finishes up as Phyllis, who he plays as being an old, enfeebled woman. Only when Deangelo \"looks into his heart\", does Michael appear before him in a bathroom mirror.",
      "After the movie, Dwight introduces Michael and Deangelo. However, moments after being introduced, Deangelo disappears into the bathroom to vomit. Eventually, Michael is able to psych him up, and the show begins. Even though he hosts it poorly, Deangelo manages to pull the ceremony off. Jim wins the \"Best Dad\" award, and in a humorous twist, not only does Pam not win \"Best Mom\", but Meredith does. Dwight wins the \"Promising Assistant Manager\" Dundie, but as he is still mad at Michael, he tosses his award in the trash.",
      "The evening takes an even more awkward turn when Erin wins the \"Cutest Redhead\" award, and she gives a speech in which she breaks up with Gabe, who takes the stage to defend himself and express his emotional pain. Michael then awards Deangelo with the \"Best Dundies Host\" award. The staff urges him to make a speech, and Deangelo, still nervous, puts on his Walkman and turns it on full blast and talks extremely loud, resulting in all of the office workers getting kicked out of the restaurant.",
      "Michael is upset that his last Dundies ended like this, but the staff manages to convince Michael to keep the Dundies going, and to host the rest of it at the office, which Michael gives in to. Dwight rides with Michael and Deangelo, and he insults the Dundies. Michael pulls over the car, and he and Dwight get into a fight, which leads to Dwight exiting the car and leaving down the highway. Back at the office, Michael and Deangelo continue to host the Dundies in the conference room. After Michael awards Andy with the \"Doobie Doobie Pothead Stoner of the Year\" Award (since Andy tried marijuana in college), he is taken by surprise when Andy leads the employees (except Dwight and Gabe, who are not present) in serenading the soon-to-depart Michael with a version (backed up on the keyboard by Darryl) of \"Seasons of Love\" with altered lyrics. Michael is touched, and in a talking-head interview held in his office, says leaving the office is going to hurt like a \"mother f**ker\".",
      "A flashback occurs where Toby gets the \"Extreme Repulsiveness\" Award. Toby mentions that he was part of the verdict in the Scranton Strangler case and is having doubts about the outcome."

Unaware of what that entails, Michael takes the advice literally and announces \"I declare bankruptcy!\" to the office, thinking that is all that is required. Seeing Michael's desperation, Oscar agrees to look over his financial situation and finds that he spends a lot of money on stuff \"no one ever, ever needs\" such as a core blaster extreme exercise machine, professional bass fishing equpiment, and multiple magic sets.",

In the middle of her diatribe, Michael runs out of the office in a failed attempt to hop a train. Jan arrives and attempts to console Michael, saying she appreciates the fact that he was there for her when she was fired. Michael fails to confront Jan about her role in his financial problems, and insists that his lack of money is no reason to have her breast augmentation reversed.",

It is the same cat, named Garbage, Dwight unsuccessfully tried to give her (in Dunder Mifflin Infinity) to make amends for his mercy killing of her cat Sprinkles. This time it works, and she gives Andy permission to ask her to dinner, with several provisos about what they will be eating. After seeing this exchange, Dwight sits alone in the stairway of Dunder Mifflin, crushed. Jim attempts to console Dwight, relaying that the pain of his own rebuffed affection for Pam is what caused him to leave for Stamford, and was so awful that \"it is something that I wouldn't wish on my worst enemy -- and that includes you\". On his way back into the office, Jim spends a last moment remembering how much he'd suffered when he couldn't be with Pam. He shakes it off and walks over to passionately kiss her in full view of everyone. Though surprised, Pam responds without a moment's hesitation, and then they discuss eating Italian food for dinner. In an interview Pam says coyly that Jim is passionate about Italian food. Jim responds in his own interview that he is in love with Italian food, implying that he's actually in love with Pam. Soon after, seemingly aided by Jim's outreach, Dwight returns to his desk and resumes his more typical, obnoxious behavior. He silently pushes away Jim's work materials that have started to encroach on his desk and makes a sales call. Jim and Pam share a poignant smile, knowing that they have helped Dwight get over Angela."

When Meredith continues to deny her alcoholism, the rest of the office find it best to go back to the party. Michael then talks with Meredith in his office before leaving the building. Meredith is told by Michael that they are going to a bar, but he actually takes her to a rehabilitation center. When Meredith sees this, she tries to escape, but Michael grabs her and drags her into the center. However, Michael learns that the staff will not check anyone in against their will, so he and Meredith leave and head back to the office.",

Dwight has bought every doll he could find in the local toy stores and explains he is going to sell the dolls to desperate parents for an enormous profit. Jim is skeptical that people would pay a high price for a doll, but he watches numerous customers come in throughout the day to purchase a doll from Dwight, all paying his asking price of $200. Toby wants to buy a doll for his daughter, Sasha, so he can be the hero this Christmas, which would irritate his ex-wife. When he goes to Dwight to purchase one, he finds that Darryl has already purchased the last one. Toby begs Darryl to the verge of tears, and Darryl offers to sell it to him for twice the price. Toby tells him that he doesn't have the money with him, but Darryl allows him to pay him back later, and Toby becomes visibly happy. He is, however, slightly shocked when the doll he gets from Darryl is a black version of the doll, but he decides not to complain.",

When Phyllis tells Angela to bring back the Christmas tree after Michael and Meredith leave, Angela refuses, telling Phyllis that she will no longer fulfill Phyllis' demands. Phyllis threatens to inform everyone of Angela's affair with Dwight, but Angela still refuses, as Phyllis would no longer be head of the Party Planning Committee if she did. As Phyllis despondently heads toward the door, she suddenly turns around and announces to the office that Angela is having an affair with Dwight, much to everyone's shock. Angela is visibly upset while Dwight is visibly amused. Pam claims that she knew it all along, which Jim initially doubts, but then decides to believe her in the spirit of Christmas. Andy, however, was absent for Phyllis' announcement, having been in the annex teaching himself to play a sitar. At the end of the episode, he returns to the party to play \"Deck the Halls\" for Angela on the sitar, before she asks him to take her home.

In an attempt to get the worried staff under control, Michael and Jim call the monthly staff meeting to provide what few assurances and optimistic viewpoints they can on the steadily worsening news. In a moment of quick thinking, Michael pulls out a party game, Belles, Bourbon & Bullets, but Jim says that they cannot afford to play around. Michael gets his way, saying Jim owes him 'one' after earlier insisting that Michael abandon his idea to run hamster tubes throughout the office, called \"Tube City\".",
      "The staff slowly warms up to the game, which is a murder mystery. It is set in Savannah, Georgia, and everyone has to adopt a Southern accent (with varying degrees of success). Thanks to Pam, Andy, and Phyllis, the game quickly becomes a hit. Almost everyone present starts to play along, except for Oscar (who tries to get updates on the situation from corporate) and Creed (who shows up late to work and flees after being told he is a suspect in a murder). Jim continues to believe the entire exercise is pointless.",
      "Throughout the game, Andy is trying his hardest to make a move on Erin, and with the possible impending closure of Dunder Mifflin, decides he needs to make a move now. While 'in character,' he asks Erin out for a weekend date, but becomes unsure if he really asked her out, or if he just simply asked out her murder mystery character, \"Naughty Nelly.\" He is worried that Erin only said yes because Naughty Nelly, a promiscuous, flirtatious, and scandalous woman, \"says yes to everyone and might be a murderer.\"",
      "Just as the game seems to get interesting, Oscar returns and reveals even more bad news from corporate. Accounting has been notified to stop payments to vendors, which is in Oscar's words \"unprecedented and should be a cause for concern.\" This brings the staff out of the game and back to the scary reality of losing their jobs. Michael tries to win them back, but accidentally skips to the game's conclusion, revealing the murderer to be Beatrix Bourbon (Phyllis). Michael refuses to give up and continues playing the game with Dwight.",
      "After the game, Andy and Erin meet at the receptionist desk, where Erin asks him about their upcoming date. Andy chickens out and indicates that the \"date\" was just part of the game, although that was not his original intention. Silence follows, and Erin leaves Andy at reception in embarrassment. She later reveals to the camera that she thought the date was real and was excited about the idea of dating Andy.",
      "In a vain attempt to salvage the day, Michael tries to introduce another murder and other twists to the story to pull his staff back into the game. This infuriates Jim to his breaking point, and they hold a private talk in Michael's office. Michael stands his ground and points out to Jim \"they need this game\" or they might cave in under the impending bad news and possible closure of Dunder Mifflin. CFO David Wallace finally returns the phone calls to Jim, and reveals that while nothing has been officially decided yet, Dunder Mifflin is expected to be insolvent by year-end. Knowing how damaging this could be to his staff, Jim deliberately hides this news from them and nudges them back into the party.

Though Michael has gone to all the trouble of bringing in bagels from which he has cut out chunks so that they will resemble the letter C, he neglected to tell the staff their new VP was coming today.

      "When Dwight returns from his sales call and demands his share of the leads, Michael advises him, \"If you want to find your leads, go to the man who never breeds.\" Dwight immediately identifies Kevin, who attempts to humiliate Dwight but only results in getting strangled. After a few seconds of being choked by Dwight, Kevin tells him that the leads are in the trash, but Erin already threw it away. Dwight heads to the dumpster, to find nothing there. Michael realizes that it's Friday and runs out into the street where a garbage truck can be seen driving away.",
      "Michael asks everyone to go to the dump with him to find the leads, but only Dwight will, fearing that Michael won't be able to find them on his own. While at the dump, Michael confronts Dwight about how Dwight no longer shows him respect. Dwight admits that he resents how being under Michael's tutelage hasn't gone as far as he thought it would. He believes he would have been in a higher position at another company had he accepted one of the other job offers he'd been given. As a result, he's still just a salesman at a company that failed under a boss that isn't going anywhere. \"I hitched my wagon to a horse with no legs.\" This results in a short trash fight, which ends when Michael accidentally dumps a sink of garbage water onto himself. The two, exhausted, rest on a bathtub and resume their friendship after a short conversation, acknowledging they'll never find the leads. Jim convinces the sales-staff to acknowledge their behavior and to give up 2% of their commissions to appease the rest of the office.",
      "Jim, Andy, Phyllis, and Stanley present the non-sales staff with a platter of pastries. The other employees are so delighted that Jim realizes that that's all it takes to earn their forgiveness. The 2% commission offer is never made. Michael and Dwight return with a dirty bean bag chair that Dwight exclaims is, \"For me and Michael only!\", showing they have become friends again.",
      "At the end of the episode, Erin and Andy are at the dump, and Erin gives Andy her coat after he states he is cold. Andy tells her that she is the nicest person he has ever met, and they have their first kiss in the landfill."

      "The episode begins with Ryan arriving at the Scranton branch and noticeably friendlier than on his previous visits. Ryan shows the staff at the branch the new Dunder Mifflin website, \"Dunder Mifflin Infinity 2.0\", the previous version of which was shut down because sexual predators had invaded the social networking component of the site. As Ryan leaves, he tells Michael of the women he meets in clubs in New York City. Michael and Dwight subsequently decide to go to New York, locate Ryan, attend parties with him, and try to meet women while doing so.",
      "In New York, Michael and Dwight locate Ryan after discovering which club Ryan frequents; the latter appears to be under the influence of drugs (coke) but Michael and Dwight do not notice. Later, Michael, Dwight, Ryan, and Ryan's colleague, Troy Underbridge wait outside another club, but fail to get in because they do not have dates. Dwight comes to the rescue when he manages to pair each of them with members of a women's basketball team, who are also waiting in line. Inside the club, Ryan's dancing becomes erratic and aggressive, and he accidentally hits a girl, prompting her friends to attack Ryan. Dwight and Michael escort him out of the club, and after Troy advises them not to take Ryan to a hospital, he runs off. Michael and Dwight bring Ryan back to his apartment, where he tells them that he thinks \"his friend Troy\" has a drug problem, and asks what he should do about it. Michael, oblivious to the fact that Ryan is obviously referring to his own drug addiction, gives him hypothetical advice involving a wiretap and snitching on a drug dealer.",
      "Back in Scranton, the rest of the employees are going to be forced to work on a Saturday to record their own sales as the website's sales, which is, according to Ryan, \"a temporary procedure to increase the legitimacy of the website\". With no one eager to participate, Jim decides to ask everyone to stay in the office overtime instead of coming in on Saturday. They all agree to the plan, and after working until 9:00 , they are shocked to find the parking lot gates locked. Jim had forgotten to tell the security guard that they were staying overtime. They are unable to return to the office because Pam locked the door from the inside, and Dwight, miles away in New York, has both the spare and master keys. Sitting in the lobby area waiting for the security guard to arrive, the employees exchange jokes and during a moment of levity, Toby affectionately places his hand on Pam's knee. After an awkward silence, Toby proclaims that he is moving to Costa Rica; he then hops the parking lot fence and runs away. Jim repeatedly calls Hank, the security guard, but he fails to show up. At the end of the episode, the cleaning staff arrives and lets the group out. Later, Hank shows up and discovers that they are not there."

Michael prepares to leave to sign the final papers for his new condo and Dwight insists that he join him as a second voice, to which he reluctantly agrees. Michael assigns Pam to have the office work on the expense reports for the afternoon. Jim asks Oscar about the expense reports and notices material on his desk that reads \"2005 SEASON\" as well as a small scoreboard. Oscar explains that he and Kevin play a paper football game when Michael's out (or when they're bored). Jim joins in and Kevin explains the game is called \"Hate Ball\", since Angela hates when they play it. Other games they play are \"Who Can Put The Most M&Ms In Their Mouth?\" and \"Dunderball.\" Michael admires his condo from the street, until he notices he's looking at the wrong house.",
      "At the condo, Michael's agent Carol introduces him to Bill, the head of the condo association and makes a Mr. Bill reference. Dwight talks about his 60-acre beet farm that he runs with his cousin Mose. He begins asking questions about the house, and Carol and Bill start to think that he and Michael are homosexual. Back at the office, Jim tries to get Stanley to join in the fun, but he outright refuses (although he is seen enjoying the games later). Michael shows the camera crew the master bedroom at the condo and starts bragging. Dwight starts to rain on his parade, bringing up the condo's weaknesses, which starts to worry Michael. In the office, Jim and Pam begin the opening ceremonies of the \"Games of the 1st Dunder Mifflin Olympiad\" in the lunch room. Jim explains they will be competing for medals made of gold, silver and bronze yogurt lids\" that Pam made herself. Angela is annoyed by the games.",
      "At the condo, Michael starts to regret his purchase when he realizes he got a 30-year mortgage and Dwight makes the situation sound even worse. Michael takes a breather before he signs the contract. Jim and Pam explain the Flonkerton race (where full paper boxes are strapped to your feet) and Phyllis challenges Kevin. Michael starts complaining about the condo to Carol and demands a price reduction, but she explains he will lose $7,000 if he walks away, so he signs. Dwight and Michael laugh about the \"saps stuck at the office\" as we see Phyllis narrowly defeating Kevin in Flonkerton.",
      "At the condo, Michael tells Dwight he is going to \"let\" him move into his third bedroom and pay rent. Dwight starts asking Michael a series of questions, which become increasingly strange. In the office, Angela tells Pam about a game she plays called \"Pam Pong\", where she counts how many times Jim goes to Pam's desk. The questions continue at the condo, which pushes Michael to the point of revoking his offer, much to Dwight's relief. At the office, the employees gather around the elevator to bet who will arrive next and Ryan wins. Pam shows Jim a box of items for the closing ceremonies and Angela marks off another tally for \"Pam Pong\", to Pam's annoyance. Toby and Oscar race with full coffee mugs around the office, but the games immediately stop when Michael and Dwight return, much to Jim's disappointment.",
      "Things get quiet again. Jim fills out the expense reports, which only take five minutes. Ryan throws away Pam's medals which she sadly notices. Pam has 59 voicemails, but attends to Jim's insistence that the closing ceremonies will occur at 5pm. Jim brings out Michael to join in the ceremonies and gives him the gold medal in front of the entire staff for closing on his condo. Michael is moved to tears. A perplexed Dwight gets the silver medal. Jim gets the bronze. Pam plays the national anthem and releases the origami paper doves she made for the ceremonies.

He remarks that things in eyes freak him out, when he sees Toby, who got hit in the eye by Pam when she threw her paper airplane. Andy is rather stressed out, and once he overcomes his fear is willing to stick his eyes in the chemical eye washer twice. Back in the office, Jim and Pam confirm they are in couple's counseling. After the first session, they become more honest with each other, lightening the stress on their relationship somewhat. At the end of the episode, Pam runs after Jim when he says he's going to Philly again. She runs out to the taxi to give him his umbrella, which he left on his desk by mistake. They embrace, although Pam is hesitant at first, but passionately kisses Jim. A Bible reading from Jim's brother at their wedding plays in the background about love. They share a synchronized \"I love you\" as the episode comes to an end, repairing and mending the breaks in their past."

Michael was very nice that evening after the Chili's meeting, letting her cry and encouraging her during this vulnerable time after her divorce, but that's all it was. She has no romantic feelings towards him. It's got nothing to do with his looks, but his personality is selfish and rude and annoying.",

      "Michael tells the camera that he's worked for Dunder-Mifflin for 12 years and has been Regional Manager for 4. The branch has the entire second floor of the building. He introduces the camera to receptionist Pam Beesly and mentions how much better she looked a couple of years ago. She gives him a fax from corporate which he crumples up and tosses into the trash, calling it his special file for messages from the corporate office. He shows the camera his World's Best Boss mug and tells how he bought it from Spencer Gifts.",
      "Jim tries to explain his job selling paper, but admits it's boring him even talking about it.",
      "Michael comes out of his office and shouts the years-old gag \"Whassssuuupp?\" to Jim and Dwight who play along.",
      "Michael's direct supervisor, Jan Levinson-Gould, then enters the office for a meeting with Michael. Michael admits he calls her Hillary Rodham Clinton, but not because he's afraid of her. Jan asks if Michael has any questions about the agenda which he claims not to have seen and proceeds to lecture Pam who then reveals, in front of Jan, that Michael threw it away. Michael backpedals that it was just a joke.",
      "Jan explains that corporate doesn't see the point in having both the Scranton and Stamford branches. Michael immediately assumes the worst. Jan tries to assure him that it's not a foregone conclusion that Scranton will be shut down. Michael wonders if Josh, the regional manager at Stamford, is worried about downsizing.",
      "Then Michael takes a call from Todd Packer, the branch's traveling salesman, who, not realizing he's on speakerphone in Jan's presence, calls her \"Godzillary\" and asks Michael if the carpet matches the drapes. Michael quickly realizes his mistake and mumbles about how inappropriate that was.",

      "In the break room, Oscar Martinez, Phyllis Lapin, and Stanley Hudson are at a table talking about the possibility of downsizing. Oscar admits he's updating his resume. Angela Martin worries she'll be let go and Kevin Malone agrees. Jim and Pam are too busy laughing about whether or not they will attend Angela's cat party on Sunday.",

In retaliation, Jim built a pencil fence between his desk and Dwight's, which Dwight smashes with his phone. Because of this, Jim tells the camera he's not afraid of the downsizing issue. Dwight, too, tells the camera he has no problem with downsizing and that he has been recommending it since he first arrived at Dunder Mifflin.",

Michael will only acquiesce to Assistant to the Regional Manager. Michael explains that he's aware of the rumors and can confirm that Jan has indicated to him that there might be downsizing which could involve either Scranton or Stamford. Both Oscar and Stanley question Michael's assurances that he will not permit this branch to be closed. To change the subject, he tries to field a question from Pam who he claims looks like she wants to ask a question. Pam mentions that, being present in the meeting with Jan, it certainly did sound like Scranton could be shuttered. Michael, who doesn't seem to recognize that this whole meeting is breaking Jan's request for confidentiality, lectures Pam about leaking information. Out in the office, Ryan expresses his concerns by phone that he's hearing rumors the branch might be shut down.",

Dwight starts to grab some photos of his car when he finds that someone has encased his stapler in Jell-O. He's furious because this is the third time and insists that Michael, as a witness, should discipline Jim. Jim, eating Jell-O, wants to know why Dwight thinks it's him. He and Ryan distract Michael by making dessert puns. Michael can't think of one.",
      "Jim tries to convince Pam to join the gang for some drinks after work. Her fiancé, Roy, one of the warehouse workers, arrives. Pam admits that she and Roy have been engaged for three years. They are supposed to be married in September, but she believes it'll probably not be until Spring. Roy tells her he just wants to go home. She leaves her desk to finish up some work. Jim tries to make small talk, but Roy isn't having it.",

      "While Michael conveys his management style to Ryan (friend first, boss second), he decides to pull a prank on Pam. When she comes in, he tells her that she's made downsizing easier because he has to fire her for stealing Post-It notes. She denies having stolen anything and bursts into tears. Ryan sits awkwardly until Michael reveals the gag. Pam calls him a jerk and storms out.",
      "Michael tells the camera that people are more important than money. The proudest day of his life was when one of his employees made him the godfather of his child. It didn't work out as they had to fire the guy because he wasn't very good.",

They use the client list as a reference for future sales and he and Dwight leave victorious. However, Michael breaks the bumper off his car trying to get out of the parking space, which catches the attention of the Prince family. They come out to help fix the bumper as much as they can as Michael watches. Michael is visibly moved by their kindness and has a change of heart regarding giving the customer list to Wallace, while Dwight remains unmoved.",

Michael obliges to send the list to Wallace, but not before he tries to escape back to Prince Paper to give them back the list. Dwight manages to chase Michael down and take the list from him, causing him to finally give in. David Wallace calls Michael to congratulate him on getting him the list.

It is revealed that, 10 years ago, in a moment of weakness while visiting an elementary school, Michael promised a group of third-graders college tuition if they graduated from high school. It had been a serious offer. Michael had assumed his salary would increase over time and he would be able to afford the tuition. Pam tells Michael he did a \"terrible, terrible thing\" and refuses to accompany him to the school, a visit he's been putting off for weeks. She's no longer the receptionist and tells Erin that she must make sure Michael shows up. Michael and Erin go to the school and see a girl, Mikela, who is thrilled to see Michael. It is clear that Michael has invested emotionally in these kids, knowing their names, going to their plays and other activities and even had a reading room at the school named after him. Michael heads into the classroom, and sees people clapping for him.",

They sing an impromptu song, and Michael awkwardly claps, but begins to realize the scope of his promise. A teacher calls Michael a dream-maker and gets emotional. A kid tells Michael that he wants to be a president and also tells Michael that he is his hero. Michael starts to cry. Michael stands up and tries to tell the tots that he cannot pay for their tuition, however, they take it as a joke. When Michael insists that he cannot pay for the tuition, they become extremely angry. Michael offers them lithium computer batteries.",

Pam has no problem believing she deserves the award as she's doubled her sales from two to four. The others protest what they believe is a rigged process in the Halperts' favor. Jim also denies there was ever a monetary award involved.",

After Dwight calls David Wallace posing as Stanley, Toby, and Kevin to complain, Wallace lectures Jim, then apologizes.

Erin tells Michael that the group of Scott's Tots has a greater graduating rate than other classes, and his promise (although he did not deliver) helped to motivate the students to complete school. Michael apologizes to Erin, and asks her about her goals with Dunder Mifflin, where she explains that she wants to try accounting, although she is doubtful of her math skills. Michael explains that he hired Kevin as an accountant, even when he applied in the warehouse because he had a \"feeling about him\". Michael then tells Erin that he has a feeling about her too, and the two begin to sing \"Hey Mr. Scott\" for the rest of the ride.",

While letting Dwight have Darryl and Phyllis, Andy chooses Kelly, Kevin and Cathy to join the team instead, upsetting Dwight. After Dwight announces who will be leaving there is much argument in the office on who gets to go and who does not.

      "Darryl discovers warehouse worker Val has knitted him a beanie. Unsure if she intended it as a romantic gift or simply one of friendship, Darryl decides to find out by giving her a Valentine's Day gift of an expensive pair of cashmere ladies' gloves with a romantic card. Upon discovering that Val had knitted a beanie for everyone in the warehouse, an embarrassed Darryl passes the gloves off to warehouse worker Nate, who's moved by the gift. Darryl is further disappointed when a man named Brandon calls asking for the address of the warehouse to send flowers to his girlfriend Val. He's intrigued, however, when she says the flowers were from her mother, despite him pointing out the caller had a deep voice and went by the name Brandon. Darryl decides that Val's gift was \"a love beanie\"."

Robert arrives with his son Bert and notices that the party is more tailored to kids than adults. In response, Andy asks Angela and Phyllis to help take over and re-tailor the party, much to Erin's chagrin. Andy also tells her that he wishes to speak with her at the end of the day. Worried about the party, she asks Gabe for help, and he gives her a tape to show everyone. Unaware of the fact that the video is full of disturbing images and no story, the office staff get upset when they see that there's hidden footage of them present in the video. Andy and Robert then talk with Erin in his office regarding the incident. Erin says that she got nervous when Andy wanted to have a talk with her, and she thought he was about to fire her regarding the party. However, Andy informs her that he is dating someone, and she is shocked to hear they have been out on 31 dates so far. Erin feels dejected and leaves.",

Bert notices what his costume is supposed to be and the two bond over playing StarCraft all day, ignoring everyone else. Dwight also makes Bert pretend to fire Toby for taking away his weapons, on the grounds that he is the CEO's son.",

Outside, they talk and it is revealed they are going to a marriage counseling class for their obvious straining relationship. Toby and Jim talk about marriage counseling as well and Jim explains that he and Pam are having problems. She doesn't like that Jim does certain things without her input and that she has to, in a sense, catch up.

Dwight enlists Clark, who happened to be in the break room when Dwight sedated Stanley, to help him get Stanley to the client meeting. They wrap him up in bubble wrap \"Evel Knievel style\" and push him down stairs covered in cardboard to act as a slide. Erin turns her computer monitor around to face the office and Angela is seen on screen with Senator Lipton, who announces that he is gay. Lipton recognizes Oscar as the one who helped him accept that he was gay. Lipton also recognizes and states his love for his Chief of Staff, Wesley Silver, who he has also been seeing, to Oscar's shock. Clark and Dwight have to struggle getting Stanley into the car. At a local talent agent's office, Andy meets a man who has a Saint Bernard, a cat on top of the dog, and a mouse on top of the cat. The man says there \"isn't a point\" in naming the mice because he goes through so many. At the client meeting, a drowsy Stanley spurts out random phrases, particularly about the children in the pictures on the desk. Back at Toby's office, Jim expresses that if Pam doesn't want to move the family to Philly, they will need a lot more than just counseling. Pam confirms to Nellie that she refuses to move to Philadelphia. Later, Nellie and Toby agree with each other that Jim and Pam are both very yappy. As Jim and Pam walk to their car, Jim rubs Pam shoulder, as if to reassure her. Andy is accepted as a client of a talent agent/real estate broker and has to pay only $5000 for the honor."

      "Dwight tries to teach fire safety by example, forcing all the doors closed and disabling the phones before setting a fire in an office trash can with a cigarette. He then says, \"today smoking will save lives.\" He returns to his desk and tries to draw attention to the smoke, asking if anyone “smells anything smoky in here?” People don't believe him at first but he clears his throat and Pam notices the smoke. During the subsequent panic, the copy machine is destroyed, Michael smashes a window to call for help and Kevin takes advantage of the havoc to raid the snack machine. Stanley collapses from a heart attack immediately following Dwight’s announcement that the whole thing was a drill. Michael, against the advice of his coworkers, tries to give CPR to an unconscious Stanley, but instead he shoves a wallet in his mouth.",
      "As Dwight's actions could have burned down the building or killed Stanley, Corporate is not amused. Michael and Dwight are called on the carpet in New York, Michael to be reminded of his responsibilities to his subordinates and Dwight to be warned that he is subject to being fired. On the drive back home, Michael revokes Dwight’s status as safety advisor. Back in Scranton, because he hadn't had any idea how to give first aid to Stanley, Michael has the American Red Cross send over an instructor (and most importantly a dummy) to teach CPR. Dwight pouts, Andy sings, and naturally no one learns anything except the lyrics to The Bee Gee's song \"Stayin' Alive\" - and that Dwight looked very realistic wearing the face of the dummy a la “Silence of the Lambs”. Most importantly, Dwight takes the scenario far too seriously and mutilates the dummy to “harvest the organs.” CFO David Wallace and Corporate HR Kendall, upset that Dwight's mutilating the dummy cost the company $3500, requires Dwight to apologize to his co-workers and get their acknowledgement of his apology in writing. Michael signs the apology without much thought, but the rest of Dwight’s coworkers refuse; everyone except Phyllis is tricked into signing the sheet, mistaking it for an attendance sheet (Phyllis only signs when Dwight has a fake delivery sent to her.)",
      "Michael tries a number of ways to get his employees to unwind, like soft music and meditation, before discovering that he is the number one cause of stress at work. So that people won't feel afraid of him, he insists on a no-holds-barred roast of himself. He actually thought that each speaker would also express love for him, so while the employees had a great time, Michael ends up with his feelings hurt. Later, after taking a \"Personnel Day,\" he recovers and conducts a mini-roast of his employees - initially making them somewhat uncomfortable, before Stanley bursts into laughter about his joke and the rest of the office jumps in.",
      "While all of this has been going on, Andy is convinced that Jim and Pam are film gurus because they are talking about Pam's parents as the three watch a pirated movie, but Andy thinks they're talking about the movie—and by chance, it sounds like it. The episode features movie stars Jack Black, Cloris Leachman, and Jessica Alba in the film, Mrs. Albert Hannaday, which features what some would consider a taboo subject, a love triangle with a \"May - late-December\" relationship. Andy does not know that Jim and Pam were actually discussing Pam's mother and father's deteriorating relationship. Pam's father stays with Pam and Jim for several days. Pam asks Jim to talk to her father and see if her dad will tell Jim what is wrong with his relationship with Pam's mother. After the two men talk her father says he is going to get his own apartment. Jim has no idea what he could have said to make Pam's father leave her mother for good. Later Pam is stunned by revelations on two fronts: 1) that Jim has been deeply in love with her since the beginning and 2) that her father never felt a deep emotion for her mother - Mr. Beesly realized the latter after hearing the former from the heart, and that was what Jim had said. In a talking heads interview, Pam says that although most children expect their parents to be soulmates, Pam and Jim’s children “will be right about that.” She also says that love affairs and relationships look different from the outside, which is overhead by a frustrated Andy, who (once again) believes she is talking about the film they watched and decides he is not fit to be a movie critic."

Jim suggests that Dwight take Phyllis to pretend to be his sister, but Dwight refuses citing Phyllis as more likely to play his \"great great grandmother who died of stupidity\" to which Phyllis remarks that she heard that. Dwight tells Jim that if he drove 240 mph he could make it to Scranton in 30 minutes. Jim then asks how long it would take if he drove 300 mph and proceeds to hang up while Dwight is calculating it.

He begins to run into problems, however, when Creed and Meredith request two different types of cake. Additionally, Andy refuses to attend unless an ice cream cake is made.

      "Dwight discusses the plan he has for the office staff on how their trip will go. He gets up early and allows for everyone to get ready by waking them up early as well. He scares Cathy awake, gets Erin up (who fell asleep reading the mattress tag), wakes Stanley up by holding his nose, Erin pretends to seduce Ryan to get him up and the two are pranked when they go to wake Jim up. Jim, who has been up for awhile, has set his hotel room up to look like he has been targeted by a gang and then proceeds to drop out of the closet pretending to be dead upon Dwight and Erin's arrival.",
      "Dwight prepares for the important meeting they are to have with Nellie Bertram, the company's Special Projects President. Jim runs into Stanley driving a red sports convertible with sunglasses and he invites Jim for a ride. At the meeting, Jim pranks Dwight by making him believe that he has poisoned Dwight. Nellie Bertram then arrives and begins to talk about the special project they are all here to work on. Jim and Dwight are horrified when they realize that Todd Packer is here as well, having landed on his feet after they sent him to Florida to pursue a fake corporate job as a ploy to get rid of him. Dwight begins to realize that he has severe pains and realizes he has to go to the hospital. He begins to leave as he is in horrible pain but suddenly realizes that Nellie is offering the position of VP of the project to anyone who can \"wow her\". Dwight decides to ignore his injury and stay. He attempts to participate but eventually falls over and is escorted to the hospital.",
      "At the office, the staff begin to wonder why it's so quiet. They suddenly realize it's because Erin has put all the phones on silent and there is no one to be the receptionist. After a failed attempt to get Pam to fill in at reception, Andy volunteers and begins to realize he really likes the job.",
      "Dwight returns to the meeting, hours after having had an appendectomy. He joins Jim, Ryan, Cathy, Erin, and Stanley as all the people have broken off into groups to all do a sales related presentation. Dwight decides to give the presentation despite being the only group member to not do any research or help with the PowerPoint. After nearly butchering the presentation, he finally impresses Bertram by telling the audience that the only element of marketing that matters is \"desire.\" Bertram subsequently invites Packer and Dwight to have breakfast with her the following day."

Dwight assigns the members of his team various tasks: Erin is to act as a disaffected hipster named Tabitha, to create hype for the Sabre Pyramid, Cathy is to flirt with the bloggers, Ryan is to give a presentation to wow the critics, Todd Packer is to play the part of a sexual predator — much to Packer's chagrin.",
      "As the grand opening progresses, things begin to fall apart. Several bloggers notice Jim not using his Sabre Arrowhead phone, resulting in a reprimand from Nellie. Erin disappears with a group of seniors after Dwight drives them away, fearing their age will frighten the youth. Finally, Ryan has a panic attack and, after being consoled by Dwight and Jim — who imitate Kelly and his mother respectively in an attempt to calm him down — leaves to go to his parents' house. Jim is forced to give the presentation, which, despite a rocky start, impresses the crowd. After the opening, Dwight is named VP by Nellie.",
      "Back in Scranton, Andy tries to protect Pam from a group of kids who are throwing pine cones at her, and a young girl, Tiffany, punches him in the eye. Andy tells a false story about stepping in when a \"gang\" harassed Pam, and Toby arranges a meeting in the conference room to discuss self-defense. Andy is then humiliated when Tiffany is brought in by her mother and half-apologizes to him and Pam. However, after a provoked Kelly begins physically harassing Toby, Andy steps in between the two to break the fight up, resulting in his other eye being blackened. The rest of the office laughs but shuts up when Andy points out he got hit twice because he defended other people who were being attacked. The episode concludes with Andy noting that he took a bunch of pain medication, drank a half a bottle of wine, and took his pants off, thus greatly improving his feelings as the day ends."

Jim sees the alliance as an opportunity with great potential and agrees as a lark. He immediately enlists Pam's help in the situation.",
      "Michael tries to boost morale in the office by having an office birthday party for Meredith, even though her birthday is a month away. Since this isn't really about Meredith, Michael has no problem despite ordering an ice cream cake even though she's lactose intolerant. He also agonizes over writing an insulting joke in her birthday card that he thinks will be hilarious. In the meantime, Oscar asks Michael for a donation for his nephew's cerebral palsy walk-a-thon. Michael looks over the $2 and $3 contributions and, feeling generous, signs up for $25. When Jim points out that the dollar amounts are per mile which adds up, Michael goes to Oscar to explain his misunderstanding. Oscar reminds him what a walk-a-thon is and thinks Michael is being cheap for retracting a charitable donation.",
      "Dwight, following Jim and Pam's efforts, ends up in a box in the warehouse to overhear information. The party falls flat when Michael's insulting jokes fail to amuse Meredith or anyone else.",
      "At the end of the day, after a breakthrough in his pranks on Dwight, Jim giddily grabs Pam's hand in an attempt to explain what has just happened. However, Pam's fiance Roy walks in and immediately assumes Jim is hitting on her. Jim tries to explain that they were just playing a joke on Dwight by pretending to be in an alliance with him. Dwight, not finding it funny, denies any knowledge."

Pam steadfastly says she will wear the same clothes she wore to work that day, and Michael tells her to unbutton her top button to \"let those things breathe a little.\" Noting that Jim will be at the convention, Michael asks Pam if she wants him to relay a message, then teases her as she is only able to get out an, \"Um...\" before he cuts her off.",
      "Creed, having earlier seen Angela \"handing out some shekels\" to Michael and Dwight, wonders how he can \"get on that train\". After being told the cash is for the Philadelphia trip, he and Meredith bash the city of brotherly love. An indignant Angela storms out of the room despite earlier mentioning a Martin family phrase — \"The slow train from Philly\" — used to indicate a potential prostitute in the vicinity. She leaves behind a plate of food that Creed immediately begins to eat. He informs Meredith that \"Andrea is the office bitch\" and proceeds to introduce himself, apparently not recognizing Meredith from the many years they have worked together.",
      "In Philadelphia, Michael calls out \"traitor\" as a friendly greeting to Jim in the hotel lobby. Dwight asks him if he's made any sales and Jim says he has \"sold about $40,000\". Dwight believes the feat impossible, and then says he has done the same, though Michael shakes his head \"no\" in reference to the fact that Dwight has not done $40,000 in sales. (In a talking head, Jim admits that he thought he had matured beyond all of the \"stupid and petty\" antics he'd pulled — at which point Dwight opened his mouth; he then takes it upon himself to obtain a key to Dwight's hotel room.) Michael also converses briefly with Stamford regional manager Josh, who informs Michael that should his branch swallow the Scranton branch, he will find a position within his new Stamford branch for Michael. A cause for concern washes across Michael's face when he hears this. Michael also queries Jan about \"the 800-pound gorilla in the room,\" Carol. Saying that Jan must keep her hands off of him during the convention, Jan tells Michael to move away from her, and Michael thanks her for her cooperation. Angela secretly arrives at the convention incognito under the name \"Jane Doe\".",
      "Michael and Dwight meet Jerome Bettis, who is signing autographs at the convention, and appear to mistake him for Mr. T. Bettis is reluctant to commit to Michael's party in Room 308. Michael informs Dwight that Bettis is nicknamed \"The Bus\" because of the pro-footballer's fear of flight. During lunch, Michael updates Jim on the Scranton happenings including Ryan taking over Jim's position and desk. Jim sends his regards and Michael promises to phone him that afternoon with the sentiment. Jim begins to ask how a former co-worker is doing, but briefly hesitates before the name, eventually naming Toby. Michael responds by asking if Toby was why Jim left, or if he had considered bosses, leading to an inquiry as to what Jim thought of Josh compared to Michael. Jim states that it's not a competition.",
      "Michael assigns Dwight to dig up any dirt on Josh. Michael takes a work-related phone call from Pam, and Jim is surprised when Michael wishes her luck on her date. Dwight informs Michael his contact at the sheriff's office isn't volunteering this day.",
      "Michael promotes a Scranton v. Stamford paper airplane game at the Hammermill booth, but his plane crashes upon takeoff. Jim and Josh head off to other business and Michael brings the Hammermill salesperson to his room where he shares his emotions over Jim leaving his branch and discusses paper with the rep. As a result, Michael surprises the entire Dunder Mifflin contingent with the news he broke Staples' exclusive hold on Hammermill products and secured a deal with the company, impressing Jan. Michael even proceeds to tip the hotel waiter with his company per diem of $100 as just another way to try and impress Jan (which belittles her).",
      "Jim has Dwight's room key and walks in on Angela (whom he mistakes for a prostitute) and he immediately leaves the room. He is shocked by the experience and tries to think of someone to call to share the news.",
      "Back in the Scranton office, Kevin expresses to Toby his lust for Pam now that she has started dating again. Toby responds by pondering and eventually aborting asking her out. Phyllis suggests Pam order an expensive entree at dinner to show she's worth it. Stanley concludes an expensive dinner requires Pam to \"put out.\" which Phyllis agrees would happen.",
      "On the double date, Kelly looks to be the only one having a good time, chatting and shoving food into a fairly embarrassed Ryan's mouth. Pam is nervous and talks to her dull date who states that he gets his comic strip ideas from the world around him, or in a dream. On a napkin, he sketches a scene referencing the 2003 freedom fries controversy, and states that it works on many levels. He reveals people tell him not to be edgy in his cartoons, but it is the only way he knows. When Pam politely laughs, Alan appears to briefly look down her shirt, causing Pam to subtly button it higher.",
      "Jim arrives on the third floor to pulsating vocoder-based electronic music and finds Michael sitting and playing with convention swag by strobe light. He says people have been filtering in and out of the party. Jim asks for a drink, and as Michael serves him a Cosmo, says he realizes that their boss-employee friendship was brief but not something Jim wanted to keep. Jim tells him he did not leave because he is a bad boss and calls Michael a great boss, and he left after he laid himself on the line to Pam and she rejected him, twice.",
      "Now understanding of the situation, Michael says he will talk to Pam, which Jim insists he does not do. Michael also suggests that Jim talk to Roy, because Roy knows exactly how he is feeling. Jim says he might. He and Michael make up and their renewed friendship is announced to party guests from the Hammermill staff.",
      "Pam's date ends with Alan picking his teeth and telling her to bring her sketches next time. She informs the camera that she has not found a love connection.",
      "A final tidbit finds Michael and Dwight preparing the black light for the Room 308 party. The light reveals stains covering the walls, comforter and headboard. Dwight speculates the stains are blood, urine, or semen, and a disgusted Michael says he hopes they are urine."

Jan informs the group the check stems from a federal reformed convict employment program, a \"smart move\" by Josh, former manager of Dunder Mifflin Stamford. She e-mails human resources and quickly determines the employee hired through the program is one Martin.",
      "Michael proposes the quartet forget the news they've received to avoid creating a rift among employees.

In an interview he says he simply doesn't like criminals. Michael himself announces Martin's \"problems with Johnny Law\" to everyone, and says that for every trusted white man, he can name a black man he trusts more. He then asks employees to call out names of white men. He tops Pam's father with \"Danny Glover\", but is unfamiliar with Jim's suggestion of \"Jonas Salk\"; Jim quickly substitutes Justin Timberlake, which garners \"Colin Powell\". Karen suggests \"Jesus\", to which the boss replies \"Apollo Creed\" to which Stanley simply rolls his eyes in casual disbelief.",

Pam comments that prison sounds better than their current work situation and Kevin wonders why the branch doesn't receive daily outdoors time.",

He speaks with a New York accent, calls Angela a bee-yoch, threatens to shove her up against a wall (and incites Dwight to politely come to her defense with the rest of the staff), says life \"in the clink\" is no picnic, alludes to violence and rape and singles out Ryan because, in prison, he would be \"da belle of da ball\", who responds \"Michael, please\" in total discomfort.",
      "Jim asks Prison Mike where he learned such information and he claims it's a mix of the Internet and prison. Jim asks his crime and Angela is peeved when Dwight asks Prison Mike the worst thing about prison, which he responds by claiming there were Dementors. Andy plays along, and says prison sounds awful. Prison Mike concludes his speech, saying \"You got a good life.\" Martin comments that Michael's performance did not remind him of his time in prison. A frustrated Michael locks everyone in the conference room, who become concerned and begin moving around for an exit. Hannah, still at her desk with the pink-clothed child, ignores Kevin's pleas for assistance.",

      "Pam supervises microwave popcorn in progress in the breakroom as Michael complains of dire hunger. He pulls a DVD copy of Varsity Blues from his office safe and calls it the only cure for Monday blues. Pam explains in an interview that Michael began Movie Monday with training videos, and continued the tradition with an ill-received medical video, likely a birthing video, six repeats of a single episode of Entourage and finally a feature film in thirty-minute increments. Prior to the screening, Michael selects an excited Kevin to recite the previous action in the film, to bring the audience up to speed.",
      "Angela states her opposition to Movie Monday and indeed is the only staffer not in attendance when Jan pops into the branch unexpectedly. Jan scolds Michael despite his explanation that productivity increases following the screenings as employees must work harder due to the lost time.",
      "In interviews, Angela and Dwight both note that Jan seems to have a vendetta against Michael for his choosing Carol over her, and fear it might affect the prospects of the Scranton branch. Angela summons Dwight to the breakroom, where they speak in their traditional manner with their back to each other. Angela tells Dwight she fears for their jobs under Michael's leadership and tells Dwight to speak to Jan about taking over the branch. In the parking lot, Dwight reaches Jan on her cell phone one hour out of Scranton. She does not want to speak but listens when he says it concerns Michael. Dwight instructs her to shop at the nearby Liz Claiborne outlet store — which he has determined to be a favorite brand of hers — until he can reach her. In order to leave, he tells Michael he is visiting a new dentist who works far away, so he will be gone for about three hours.",
      "Jan and Dwight sit at a nearby diner where he orders two plates of waffles and begins to propose taking over the branch. Pouring syrup maniacally and proceeding to eat in a deliberate way for effect, he states that he could do the job better by firing half the staff, to whom he swears no loyalty since he doesn't care about any of his co-workers. As the meeting ends and Dwight sloppily devours his meal in front of her, he urges Jan to check out a new Ann Taylor outlet store nearby, as he has noticed that she is fond of the brand's earrings. Jan calls Michael, relays the entire meeting and demands he gets his branch under control.",
      "the Stamford branch has its own distraction, the computer war game Call of Duty, being played under the guise of a team-building exercise. New to the game, Jim plays poorly and he mentions video games weren't played at his former office. He does, however, reveal a prank in which he and Pam hummed the same high note in the hopes of Dwight scheduling an appointment to have his hearing checked, an activity Pam dubbed \"pretendinitis\".",
      "Back in Scranton, Pam shops online for new clothes at Kelly's insistence. Upon the clothes' arrival, Kelly demands through chanting that Pam performs a lunchtime fashion show. Though Kelly, Phyllis, and Meredith compliment her on her clothes, Pam claims \"it's too much\" and considers returning them. Roy enters the breakroom and tells Pam she looks pretty. Kelly asks if that is his third soda of the day, to which he doesn't respond.",

As another game starts up, Josh calls Jim and Andy for an impromptu huddle about game strategy. Andy blames the defeat on \"the new guy,\" and as Jim reveals his use of a sniper rifle, both co-workers react in disgust, with Josh scolding Jim for using the weapon on an inappropriate map, and Andy claiming he is going to shoot Jim \"for real.\"",

Later, Michael tells Dwight that Jan has called to demote him to Dwight's position as Assistant (to the) Regional Manager, and Dwight should be expecting a call from Corporate to take over as acting Regional Manager. Announcing it to the office, multiple people question Dwight's selection, and Kevin even expresses concern about Michael possibly losing his condo. Angela is the only one to congratulate Dwight, though later when she says in private that they could make a difference together, he corrects her to say as he would make a difference. Though Angela seems upset at first, she then smirks as Dwight offers her to be in charge of the female staff.",
      "Michael eventually reveals the trick when Dwight casually refuses the keys to Michael's Corporate Chrysler Sebring convertible and insults the vehicle due to its poor gas mileage and impracticality in Scranton's climate. Taking the remark personally, Michael blows up at Dwight after he refuses to take back what he said, especially after Dwight previously stated that he loved the car (a lie meant to appease Michael). In turn, Dwight begins to beg for his job and grovels at the floor for Michael's forgiveness, offering to do his laundry for a month, then a year, to which Michael responds he has a laundry machine. Michael then forgives him and tells him to \"Hug it out, bitch,\" which, Michael tells the camera, is what men say and do to each other after a fight (a reference to Michael's obsession with Entourage). Dwight returns quickly to being Michael's loyal right-hand man at the next Movie Monday, as Angela looks on in disappointment.",
      "Pam decides to return to dressing her usual way at work when Creed walks over to her desk, blatantly looks down her shirt and refuses to leave the area. Pam covers up with a sweater and decides to keep the clothes for outside of the office.",

Karen tells the camera to \"look at how cute he is,\" before telling Jim to turn his character around. Requesting any last words, she shoots his character point blank. Jim then turns to the camera and whispers \"psychopath.\" At the end of the day, Jim pretends to throw a grenade towards her desk when leaving, to which she tosses a few paper clips in the resulting explosion. They laugh, and after he leaves, she still gives a slight wave and continues to stare at the exit.",

Worried sick, Michael hires Dwight to tail her to see if she is spending time with anyone else. Dwight follows Donna to her gym and attempts to seduce her. Donna rebukes him and calls security on him, whereby he openly admits he was sent there by Michael to watch her. Dwight comes back to the office and says to Michael that Donna isn't cheating, and that Michael has to pay for his gym membership (since he must pay for any of the fees Dwight had during the investigation). An enraged Donna comes to the office to talk to Michael about the whole situation, but the two forgive each other and reconcile by planning a private vacation together.",

Andy becomes frustrated when Gabe fails to take his customer's complaint seriously. Capitalizing on his fears, Darryl pranks Andy into believing he has uncovered a major conspiracy. Darryl is pranking Andy in retaliation for his blaming one of his mistakes on the warehouse a few years earlier, an act that put Darryl's career at Dunder Mifflin in jeopardy. After pretending to help Andy to not get fired for knowing that the printers may be dangerous, Darryl agrees to film Andy testing a printer in a typical fashion to test his burning printer theory. During the shooting of the video, while Darryl is pranking Andy into speaking with a high pitch voice, the printer indeed catches fire and explodes. This confirms Andy's suspicions, and terrifies Darryl who vows to never prank again.",

While Donna and Michael are planning their trip, Pam investigates Donna's Facebook account and finds pictures of her hugging and kissing another man. At first she and Jim had been skeptical of Donna cheating, and even berated Michael for having destructive tendencies with his personal life, as well as his eating a bowl of mayonnaise and olives due to stress. But now they realize his fears had been correct and try to warn him as best they can. Pam shows Michael the pictures she found and he confronts Donna with the evidence. At the end of the episode, Donna reveals that she is indeed cheating, but not on Michael - with Michael. She is actually married to someone.",

Kelly goes all trash talk on Pam, about how Pam's boyfriend \"sucks\" at ping pong, but Kelly calls it \"talking smack.\" Pam gets ticked off and sets up a practice ping pong table in the conference room so she can get back at Kelly by way of Jim and Darryl. She gets Kevin and then Dwight as \"sparring partners\" for Jim, but Dwight easily defeats Jim. Dwight reveals for the first time that he is a huge lifelong table tennis fan, and he reels off the names of immortals of the sport whom he idolizes.",
      "At corporate, Michael is (maybe) all set to support Jan during the deposition hearing, but Ryan then takes him aside and urges him to do the right thing and not hurt Dunder Mifflin. Michael agrees and then is left with a terrible conflict. Michael's testimony starts well when he mentions the inappropriate way corporate handled Jan's situation, but his comments about her drinking and about apparent conflicts in statements he made about the nature of their relationship and when it started to cause problems.",

      "In a last-ditch attempt to win Michael back to her side, Jan has her lawyer read the deposition of David Wallace.

      "Andy still hasn't found out about fiancee Angela's affair with Dwight seventeen days after Phyllis revealed it to everyone else in the office. Michael suggests that somebody inform Andy, but the entire office is against that idea; Jim is particularly concerned that Andy's past anger management issues may lead to in-office violence between Andy and the combative Dwight. Michael then asks Andy to accompany him to the parking lot before he leaves for a meeting with David Wallace. Michael carefully times the conversation so that he reveals the affair while simultaneously driving out of the parking lot. A shocked and dismayed Andy heads back into the office to confront Angela regarding the affair, but she continues to hold back, as everyone else looks on. Andy then confronts Dwight about it and challenges him to a duel in the parking lot over who gets Angela, which Dwight accepts. Angela finds this flattering. Jim, acting in Michael's stead, concedes that he does not have the power to prevent them from fighting outside of work, but he locates and confiscates most of Dwight's hidden weaponry throughout the office.",
      "in New York, Michael is nervous as to why David Wallace called a meeting with him. He is, however, surprised and relieved to hear that David is proud of Michael for making the Scranton branch the most successful one, as the other branches are struggling due to the current economic crisis. David wants to know what Michael is doing to make his branch productive and Michael is unable to come up with a reason, speaking off topic for most of the meeting, but David understands that it is hard for someone to come up with a self-evaluation and lets him leave. Michael then thanks David for holding him in high esteem.",
      "Dwight waits in the parking lot for Andy, who doesn't show up on time. Dwight then finds a note hanging in the bushes in an empty parking space from Andy, saying he is giving up. Andy is actually in his car (a Toyota Prius), which, as Oscar points out, is silent below 5 MPH (due to the electric motor). Because Dwight is unable to hear him, Andy drives into the empty space and pins Dwight between the car and the bush. After much banter between the two--in which Andy complains about Angela's affair, and Dwight makes fun of how pathetic he thinks Andy is--Andy reveals he had slept with Angela only twice. Dwight is shocked as Angela told him she was only sleeping with Dwight. They both head back into the office, where Andy makes a call to cancel his wedding cake (which was shaped like a sailboat) and Dwight throws out his bobblehead doll, which was a gift from Angela, as a dismayed Angela looks on."

Oscars sums up the Dundies \"as like a kid's birthday party, where there's nothing for you to do, but the kid's having a good time.\" As everyone prepares to order, Michael tells them they have to pay for their meals and drinks. Michael's jokes fall flat; Dwight's contributions also are not helpful. Darryl and Roy, concluding that the awards are lame, leave early, taking Pam with them. In the parking lot, Pam and Roy have an argument, and Pam returns to the awards show, just in time for Michael's caricature of a Chinese man named Ping.",

Pam braces herself for her annual \"World's Longest Engagement\" award, but is relieved to get the \"Whitest Sneakers\" award. Pam thanks Michael and, after an emotional acceptance speech, drunkenly kisses Jim on the lips.",

While people try to express their condolences, Dwight is not interested and explains that the two pails he holds each contain either red, fertile dirt in which if he throws it in your face, you are invited to the funeral and the other contains black, acidic dirt to which if thrown in your face he asks that you keep away from him during his time of mourning. He throws the black dirt in everyone's face except Oscar. When he gets to Jim, Dwight fills his hand with acidic dirt, but instead of throwing it at Jim, he throws it directly on and across Pam's cheek. Then he soaks another one in coffee and throws it at Jim's face.",
      "Dwight stands on the porch of his house at Schrute Farms, while Mose gently plays guitar and sings. His cousin Zeke pulls up on his motorcycle to take Dwight to the funeral at Shirley's farm nearby. Both of them argue over who has to get in the sidecar and the argument culminates in both of them in the drivers seat. Dwight and Oscar meet at the funeral and Oscar expresses surprise when he see's Dwight's brother pull up in a car that drives into the grave intended for Aunt Shirley. Oscar is even more struck by Dwight's beautiful sister, Fanny from Chicago. She is a single mother of a boy named Cameron.",
      "While at the funeral, rather than recall fond memories of Shirley like most families, all the guests instead state a fact about her while she was alive to which Oscar sarcastically says of the Schrutes \"they're a descriptive people\". A group of farmers arrive at the funeral and Dwight flirts with Esther, one of the girls from a neighboring farm. Oscar becomes worried and leaves after Dwight takes a shotgun and begins firing into the open coffin in order to ensure that Shirley is dead and not just a deep sleeper as incidents in the past have occurred.",
      "Back at the office Todd Packer reappears and admits that he is in recovery and is on step 8 of Alcoholics Anonymous (and step 9 of Narcotics Anonymous) in which he must make amends with the people he has wronged. He proceeds to apologize to everyone, but Pam points out that he is just insulting people and disguising it as an apology. Packer realizes this and to show he is truly sorry, begins to distribute cupcakes that he bought for everyone. Everyone seems willing to accept his apology, but Pam calls a meeting in the conference room as she is not willing to let everyone forgive Packer just because he is handing out cupcakes.",
      "As everyone gathers in the living room at the funeral, they watch a tape Aunt Shirley recorded for her family to watch upon her death. In the video, she tells Dwight, his brother Jeb, and Fanny that she will give them her farm if they move back home. She thinks that Jeb, a pot farmer in California, and Fanny, a single mom in the city, need to return home and get back to their family traditions. Jeb seems interested, but Fanny doesn't want to and Dwight's usual means of manipulation don't work on his sister.",
      "Pam convinces the office that they should not accept Packer's offering. Packer continues to insult people and Kevin struggles not to eat his cupcake as everyone tries to distract him.",
      "Dwight uses the tactic of nostalgia to convince his sister to return home. As the Schrute family sings, Fanny begins to realize that she misses her home and becomes impressed when Dwight begins to court Esther by placing a pair of crow's beaks at her feet. According to Schrute tradition, if the girl is interested, she will crush the beaks, and Esther does. Dwight later goes to the barn at night and begins to do his usual work and Cameron follows him. He observes Dwight perform the task of taking eggs from hens and Cameron overcomes his fear of chickens to take an egg and Dwight seems proud. Dwight later tries to show him how to milk a goat, but when Cameron is unable to discern between good milk and bad milk, Dwight loses his patience and his uncle instincts prove fickle.",
      "When Pam comes in the next morning, she announces that she thought about it and that she is going to eat her cupcake. The rest of the office looks terrible and they reveal to Pam that Packer had laced the cupcakes with a wide range of drugs. In an earlier scene, before the cupcakes were eaten, Packer proudly tells the cameras he was never in rehab and spent six hours carefully removing the frosting and layering in both legal and illegal drugs in order to get revenge on the office staff who he believes were responsible for his firing. Everyone is recovering from the effects of the drugs and they tell stories of the incidents that occurred. When people ask Andy what his effects were, he and Kevin start acting very awkward and pretend that nothing happened, as the cameras show clips of them becoming high and performing a number of weird activities such as rubbing each other's faces, trying on each other's clothes, and dancing.",
      "Fanny realizes how much she misses home and sees that Cameron seems to enjoy the farm life. She agrees to return home and work Shirley's farm with Dwight and Jeb. As they arrive at her farm and realize how big it is, they all look at each other and agree that they are ready for the task. ",
      "Todd Packer is seen apologizing to two men who are unseen before he hands each a box with a drug-filled cupcake in it. The cameras reveal that the two men are Jim and Darryl and Todd is visiting them at Athlead. Both thank Todd for this and Todd proceeds to give a devilish smile to the camera."

      "Michael burns his foot stepping on to a George Foreman grill, and then tries to convince his staff that he has a serious injury. To do this, he irritates the office (Pam and Ryan, notably) to help him with his \"injury\". For example: He asks Pam to spread butter on his foot, and when Michael falls off the toilet, he yells for Ryan to help him. When Ryan refuses to do this, Michael calls a meeting in the conference room. During all this, Dwight, who tries to pick Michael up and bring him in to work upon hearing of his injury, crashes his car exiting Dunder Mifflin's parking lot, giving himself a concussion. Because of this Dwight is more helpful and friendly to Pam, which Jim notes. In the conference room meeting, Michael shows pictures of handicapped people (Forrest Gump, Franklin D. Roosevelt, Tom Hanks as Josh Baskin in Big which he mistakes for Philadelphia.) Then the handicapped business park manager enters and is told he was invited by Michael to come. When he asks if anyone has any questions about the building rules, Dwight raises his hand and says nothing. When Michael tells the building's manager that they are similar because they are \"disabled\" this causes him to wheel out. When Jim sees him enter the elevator he asks Jim \"What's wrong with that guy?\" meaning Dwight. He then states that he looks like he has a concussion. Ryan, sick of Michael, puts medicine in his pudding to help him recover. While Michael is boasting about his recovery, Dwight collapses, and Jim and Michael (Michael being less than willingly) take him to the hospital. While Jim waits in the waiting room, he calls Pam at the office, and tells her that Michael is taking Dwight to get a CATscan. Angela tries to listen into this. The episode ends with Michael trying to stick his foot into the CATscan machine."

Ryan pretends to be Kelly's supervisor as a way to suck up to the new boss, asking Kelly to play along. Dwight wants Deangelo to leave him alone. Deangelo claims to be a great juggler. He doesn't have his balls at the office, so he puts on an invisible juggling show. Later, while having lunch, Angela protests that Deangelo is sexist, and Pam asks Jim to confront him on it. After said confrontation, Deangelo responds by hiring a woman named Jordan Garfield.",

Dwight yells to Deangelo, \"Tell your whore to leave me alone!\" Kelly breaks down and tells Deangelo the truth regarding Ryan not being her supervisor, using the movie Rango as a comparison. Deangelo states that he likes things the way they are and decides to make Ryan Kelly's supervisor for real. As Jim works his way back into the circle, Pam takes it upon herself to try to keep Deangelo quiet when his game of Nerf basketball disrupts the office. Deangelo claims he can do Michael Jordan's dunk and Jim asks him to show everybody at the real basketball hoop down in the warehouse. Deangelo accepts the offer and forces everyone to come and watch. Dwight passes but Deangelo yells, \"Damn it, Dwight! Enough! Get your ass downstairs or find a new place to sell paper!\"",
      "When attempting a dunk, Deangelo tips the basketball hoop over onto himself, and he is seen being carried off in an ambulance in the next shot. At the end, Deangelo tries to return to work while still in his hospital gown, along with many tubes, clearly suffering from brain damage of some sort. He tries to tell a bartender joke in a jumbled and muffled language before Jim and Gabe escort him out."

      "Robert California is appointed Regional Manager of the Scranton Branch, but quits on his first day, travels to Florida and convinces Jo Bennett to give him her position as CEO of Dunder Mifflin-Sabre. Andy is then appointed Regional Manager in Scranton, and makes it his goal for the office to receive a half day off on the Friday before the Columbus Day weekend.",
      "Erin finds Robert's notebook recording a list of Scranton's employees in two columns with a line down the middle. This causes the office to become frantic with what the list attributes to. Andy asks Robert about it, who brushes it off as \"doodles,\" and conspicuously moves Andy's name from the left column to the right. Later that day, Robert invites the employees in the left column to lunch, including Jim, Dwight, Angela, Kevin, Phyllis, Toby and Oscar. After they leave, Andy treats the remaining staff to a pizza party, but they are not happy about being left behind and do not respond to his sincere efforts to make them feel better.",
      "During lunch, the \"left-siders\" pester Robert about the list, who, in-between beers, informs them that the left-siders are \"winners\" while the right side are \"losers\". Jim is astonished, but the others become cocky. Kevin sends a mass text to the right-siders, mocking them as \"losers\", and later squirts Meredith with a water pistol. Andy does not like this and confronts Robert with a demand to alter the list. Robert refuses, and then speaks to everyone by admitting to calling certain members of the office losers, but also saying he will be working with them a long time and that his opinions on certain people may very well change, finishing with \"Winners, prove me right; losers, prove me wrong\". Andy, unfazed, lists off the qualities the right-siders have, stating that Stanley may be a grump, but has the best sales record in the office (something Robert admits to being unaware of); Meredith is persistent and does not know what the word \"no\" means; and Pam is one of the kindest people he knows. Andy concedes to Robert that putting Gabe in the losers' column was \"astute\". Andy then demands the Columbus half day, responds to Robert's comment about Columbus being responsible for genocide with \"I DON'T CARE\" and exits, prompting a respecting smile from Robert. Though the office annually gets the half day in any case, they happily wish him good evening as they depart, and Andy looks very pleased with his work as the boss.",
      "Pam is pregnant with her and Jim's second child (revealed to be a boy) and is emotional, easily brought to tears throughout the day. Angela is also pregnant, having married the state senator Robert Lipton over the summer, and says that she's \"Little Preg\" to Pam's \"Big Preg\". When Jim picks up his things to leave for the day, he knocks over a piece of paper. Pam picks it up and sees Jim's personal winners and losers list: Pam, CeCe and their new baby are on the left, and everything else is on the right. Pam tearfully vows to frame it."

Kevin is given the job of shredding the company documents from Stamford, which he relishes. As he demonstrates the power of his shredder from Staples, Kevin gets carried away and accidentally shreds his credit card. As Michael is putting nameplates on the ex-Stamford employee's desks Dwight suggests that they fire Tony Gardner to consolidate power. In an interview, Dwight says that he would have been good as the Japanese soldier who chose which prisoner to execute once a new batch of prisoners arrived.",
      "In a parking lot interview next to his Nissan Xterra, Andy proclaims he'll be the No. 2 man in Scranton in six weeks time through \"name repetition, personality mirroring and never breaking off a handshake.\" Indeed, he echoes Michael's \"Aloha\" greeting and refers to his \"nifty gifty\" bag, which contains mostly pencils and coupons to local Scranton \"hot spots\". Pam is sitting at her desk fascinated by their semi-awkward conversation. Michael admits during a talking head that he is fond of Andy and thinks he has a likable way about him. Jim walks in the door, and Pam is obviously extremely smitten to see him since she hasn't seen him in a long time, and still has feelings for him. Dwight instructs Jim not to mess with him, as he is older and wiser. Jim gapes at Dwight's forehead, freaking him out.",

Andy mentions his title contains the word 'director' which outranks a 'manager' on a film set and questions Dwight if he knows anything about film. Dwight states he knows everything about film since he has seen over 240 of them. Jim goes over to say \"hi\" to Toby and is then somewhat confused when Toby invites him to \"pound\" it.  An elated Kelly hugs Jim and informs him there is a lot she must catch him up on and proceeds to tell him about the babies Tom Cruise & Katie Holmes and Brad Pitt & Angelina Jolie had. Jim then asks Kelly what's new with her and she replies, \"I just told you.\"",

When informed she eats beef, he says to treat it like poisoned beef, because the snacks are for guests. In a familiar manner, Karen gives Jim a stick of gum and Pam notices. Michael plays a videotape he has created called \"Lazy Scranton\" featuring himself and Dwight rhyming over the music of Saturday Night Live's \"Lazy Sunday\". Jim says the video treat reminds him of his orientation film: \"The Scranton Witch Project.\" The viewer is shown a brief clip of that film, which features Michael illuminated by a flashlight saying he \"gets so scared when people don't label their personal food.\" While it is clear that everyone is bored, Michael says that he thought the video would be an \"A\" or an \"A+\"; then, he remembered that there is an \"A++\".",
      "In the coffee room, Pam notes that Jim has purchased a bottle of water from the vending machine instead of grape soda that he used to frequently purchase while at Scranton. Jim simply replies \"I'm evolving, Pam.\" which to note, his sleeves are buttoned up. Pam then questions when Jim is going to tell her everything and if he is interested to go for a coffee after work. Jim replies not tonight since he is still settling in and then Michael walks in the room, making things more awkward.",
      "In a series of vignettes, Stamford transplants are distracted by their new Scranton coworkers: Ryan by Hannah's open use of a breast pump; Karen by Phyllis's perfume from metropolitan Orlando; Martin by Creed's feet-up, boisterous phone conversation. In an interview, Stanley questions the audacity of \"these new people\" and mentions he's silently sat downwind from Phyllis's stinky perfume for years.",
      "The integration portion of Michael's orientation finds four new employees sitting in chairs on the banquet room table. Karen asks Michael why they aren't being treated as equal. The boss and Dwight try to force hefty, skeptical Tony up on the table, and he quits instead. Jan later calls Michael and yells at him for firing Tony when he tried to quit (an impulsive decision Michael made after feeling insulted by Tony's attempt). She complains that because Michael fired Tony rather than letting him quit like he wanted to, Dunder Mifflin has to pay him severance. Michael initially uses Dwight as a scapegoat by saying \"Bad advice from my number two.\" of which Jan corrects him and says Jim is actually going to be the number two. This is eventually brought into a meeting between Michael, Dwight, Jim and Andy and culminates in yet another battle between Dwight and Andy for Michael's respect.",
      "After Tony leaves the room, Hannah walks out, agreeing Michael is unprofessional. A short while later, Michael runs into the office and tells everyone to go down to the parking lot because someone has let the air out of all their tires. The employees rush down to see what is going on and Michael blames Vance Refrigeration employees. Michael suggests stealing all of the refrigerators from Bob Vance in retribution. Martin notes Michael's tires remain fully inflated, but Michael says they left a hate note under his windshield wiper reading, \"You guys suck! You can never pull together as one and revenge us. That is why you suck!\" Everyone shakes their heads in disbelief at what Michael has done. Once again, Pam noticed Karen casually touching Jim's back with her hand as they walk away. Later, all the employees are shown talking to each other and getting along due to a common interest: Michael as an unprofessional boss. Michael watches from his office and comments how a common enemy has brought the Stamford and Scranton employees together, although he apparently believes that the employees have fallen for his scheme and consider Vance Refrigeration the common enemy, not Michael himself.",
      "Jim sits in his Toyota Corolla and receives a call from Karen to meet up. He quickly ends the conversation as he sees Pam and runs over to say the day had been awkward and that he feels he should tell her he is seeing someone. She denies awkwardness and states that they'll always be friends.",

In separate interviews, Pam says that the attack on Jim by Roy \"sucked\", and Jim says that he was lucky that Dwight had been there and that Roy was lucky that Dwight only used pepper spray. Dwight is then seen showing his cache of weapons that contains nun-chuks and ninja stars.",
      "Jim is then seen thanking Dwight, but Dwight will not accept the thanks. Jim then tries to give Dwight a gift, but Dwight claims he \"doesn't want it, doesn't need it, and won't accept it\". In an interview, Dwight explains his reasoning for not accepting the thanks, saying the \"real heroes\" were superheroes. Oscar tells Angela about Dwight's brave efforts, and Angela struggles not to appear too enthralled, but is clearly very proud of Dwight.",
      "Michael and Jim are then seen in Michael's office, and Michael asks Jim to role-play as Darryl, asking for a raise. Michael is equipped with a list of negotiation tactics that he acquired from Wikipedia, \"the best thing ever\". In Michael's first tactic, he lowers his voice to create a position of power, but Jim is less than impressed. Michael's second tactic, \"leaving the room unexpectedly\", is a \"surprise\". When Michael leaves the room in their second role-play, somewhat expectedly, Jim starts talking quietly, stopping Michael on his way out the door, and confusing him.",
      "Later, Dwight recites the attack on Jim to Toby rather monotonously, ending his description of the events with \"...the end\". After Dwight leaves, Kelly and Ryan begin arguing in the next cubicle, rather loudly, and Toby, in an interview, questions whether Michael would have moved Ryan in with Kelly as a way to punish him, well aware that the relationship between Toby and Michael is rather unpleasant.",
      "Darryl enters Michael's office, and Michael employs a tactic in which he changes the location at the last second, presumably as another way to gain a position of power. In the conference room, Michael attempts to employ a tactic in which he declines to speak first, but fails. While Darryl and Michael enter a discussion relating to Darryl's request for a raise, Michael stands and walks to the window, and Darryl notices that Michael is wearing a woman's power-suit.",
      "Michael quickly leaves the conference room, and desperately tries to prove Darryl wrong by getting Pam to look at his suit. Pam agrees that it is a woman's suit, and Michael says in an interview that he got it out of a clothing bin. Kevin asks Michael who makes the suit, and Michael looks at the label on the inside of the jacket (which is lined with pink silk). The label reads \"MISSterious\". Michael shows Pam the back of his pants, which don't use a belt, but thin elastic. Also, the pants don't have any pockets.",
      "Michael later regrets making one \"tiny\" little mistake in his negotiation: he \"wore a woman's clothes\".",
      "Later, Karen tells Angela about the attack on Jim, and Angela experiences a euphoric interest in Dwight's bravery. Michael is back to discussing Darryl's raise, and uses his tactic of lowering his voice, but ends up simply talking with a slow, strained voice.",
      "Pam apologizes to Jim, and Jim accepts her apology, but seems slightly resentful at Pam and Roy's connection. He comments on the way that Pam and Roy are \"bound to find their way back to one another eventually\". Still in discussion, Michael reveals to Darryl how much he makes each week, and Darryl seems to find Michael's salary unbelievably low, especially considering how long Michael has been with the company (fourteen years).",
      "Jim offers Dwight a free beer after work, but Dwight refuses this gesture, as well. Jim confides in Karen as to why Dwight is so easy to play pranks on, but so hard to be nice to. Karen tries to help, but suggests that Jim simply \"try and sell some paper\" so that they can take a trip. Kevin and Creed are later seen giving Michael money, presumably because they found out about Michael's low salary, and Stanley, in an interview, claims that Michael is still \"way overpaid\".",
      "Eventually, Darryl convinces Michael to ring Jan and ask for a raise for himself. Outside Michael's office, Creed tells his version of the attack on Jim to Angela, but Creed is clearly confusing events, and Angela, disappointed, calls him \"useless\". Michael is then seen talking to Jan over the speaker phone, with Darryl nearby, and Jan says that Michael should come to Corporate Headquarters to negotiate a raise. Michael agrees, but almost backs out when he finds out he has to bring Toby. Michael is eventually convinced, though.",
      "Toby is grateful to get away from Ryan and Kelly's bickering, and Michael, Darryl and Toby head to Corporate HQ in Darryl's cramped truck.",
      "On the way there, Darryl says that his cousin has a big place in New York, and that Toby could stay with them. Michael says that he might stay, to which Darryl replies \"it's not that big\". Kelly is describing the attack on Jim to Angela, but Kelly gets a phone call, and says that Angela should just look at Toby's report. While Kelly is on the phone, Angela takes the report from Toby's desk.",
      "At Corporate HQ, Michael enters Jan's office, with some encouragement from Darryl.",
      "Roy returns to the office with a security guard to get his last paycheck, and apologizes to Jim. Dwight tenses and stands up, but doesn't do anything except discreetly take out his nun-chuks. On his way out, Roy convinces Pam to meet him for coffee after work to talk things through. As Roy leaves, Kevin warns Jim of Roy's presence in the office.",
      "At Corporate Headquarters, the negotiation begins. Michael meets Jan's new assistant, a young man, and asks Jan \"who's the boy-toy?\". After specifically being told not to bring their relationship in to the negotiation, Michael, disappointed at Jan's six percent raise offer, threatens Jan with no sex. Toby, who is being a third-party stand-in, writes something down, and Michael calls him a \"perv-ball\".",
      "While getting coffee, it is initially tense between Pam and Roy, but eventually they talk openly. Roy is puzzled when Pam says she isn't going to try to win Jim over, saying if she does not, then all of what had happened would be for nothing. They hug, Pam wipes a tear from her face, and they part ways. Back at the office, Jim leaves a fake certificate of bravery on Dwight's desk, but Dwight unexpectedly sees through Jim's ploy, and Jim is left once again with no way to repay Dwight for his bravery.",
      "At HQ, Toby is asked to leave the room and Michael tells Jan about all the bad things that had happened to him lately: \"I accidentally cross-dressed...and then Darryl made me feel bad for not making any money...and then I had to ride up here with stupid Toby...and then your assistant was all young and hot...\". Jan eventually offers Michael a twelve percent raise.",
      "Michael reflects in an interview about the day's events. He claims that \"life isn't about salary - it's about perks, like having sex with Jan\", of which Jan is standing next to him and immediately rebuffs his comments as they leave. Back at the office, Angela tells Dwight about how proud she is of him, and they begin to passionately kiss. Jim emerges from the washroom and sees this from the window, a distance away. He quickly runs back inside the washroom, and says that he and Dwight are now even, because he won't tell anybody about what he saw.",
      "The episode closes with Andy returning from anger management.  He enters the office seemingly ready to make amends with his co-workers. However, he can barely get a word out when Dwight hits him with the pepper spray and Andy falls to the floor in pain. Toby is then seen confiscating all of Dwight's weapons (which include, a taser, a boomerang, handcuffs, a nightstick, a pair of brass knuckles, and a samurai sword) In an interview Dwight claims that unlike Hiro from Heroes and Bono, he is \"not a hero\"."

      "The office is still trying to adjust to having both Michael and Jim as bosses, with Jim getting a newly built personal office space in the main section. Michael and Jim constantly find themselves at odds with each other as Michael keeps having \"conference room meetings\" while Jim wants to keep productivity in the office place. They get a call from CFO David Wallace who tells them that not everyone in the branch will get their desired raise and that they will have to decide how to disperse it among the employees. Michael gets annoyed when Jim keeps making pros and cons lists for each idea. Jim decides to give the raises to the sales staff since they bring money to the company. Michael is against the idea, but invites Jim to announce it to the office.",
      "Jim tells the office that they are only going to give raises to the sales staff, which clearly upsets the non-sales staff. Dwight, not wanting Jim as a boss, complains about the unfairness of Jim's decision despite being a salesperson. Michael, who was scoffing at Jim, is then asked to give his idea, but he does not speak coherently about it, leading everyone to say that Jim was at least being direct despite having a bad idea. Michael and Jim go back into the conference room to decide how to handle the raise issue. They ultimately decide that the raises should be performance-based, and decide to take turns placing beans on employee pictures to determine how much of a raise each person deserves. Jim believes that it is a good idea, but when Michael and Jim leave the conference room, Dwight goes into the conference room and shows the employees their plan. Everyone gets upset at Michael and Jim for this, particularly Pam, whose picture did not have any beans, as Jim was trying to remain unbiased.",
      "With the entire office now upset with both Michael and Jim, Dwight uses this opportunity to start an uprising against Jim personally. However, everyone in the office refuses to as they are more concerned about the raise issue. Michael then goes into Jim's office to check on him. Michael explains he felt terrible having to make those kinds of decisions on his own and he leaves to get Jim something. Jim comments that Michael is currently his only friend in the office at the moment, as everyone else, even probably Pam, is upset at him about the raise situation. Michael returns to give Jim his own new \"World's Best Boss\" mug and they share some gin together.",

She initially wants the $100, but after he tells her about an algorithm that can determine the winner of any college basketball game, she agrees to the $5,000.

He has relocated to Dwight's former desk where he severely irritates Jim and Ryan, whom he attempts to nickname \"Big Turkey.\" Andy casts an invisible fishing line in a pantomimed attempt to hook Jim (the \"Big Tuna\") and calls his own cell phone in order to demonstrate his new \"Rockin' Robin\" ringtone. Andy explains he recorded himself singing all four parts of harmony. He also repeatedly sings one portion of The Cranberries song \"Zombie.\" Despite his earlier claims of a cappella singing experience, his pitch goes flat.",

This pleases Kevin, who admits he devised the joke shortly after Oscar left and had been waiting weeks for the opportunity to use it. Angela pensively invites Oscar to join the party planning committee. At first, he is offended, believing she is ridiculing him since the committee consists only of women. However, Angela respectfully continues to ask, apologizing for the way that \"certain events\" transpired.

In a carefully choreographed plan, Jim steals Andy's cell phone and leaves it with Pam. Later, Pam hands it back to Jim as he heads for the kitchen and stands guard as Jim pushes up a ceiling tile and launches the phone through the empty space to its final resting place, atop a tile roughly above Andy's desk. Karen briefly notices the actions of the two. The pair trade calls to Andy's phone, frustrating him to the point of accusing Phyllis of the theft, who ignores him.",

Andy offers to hang out with Michael, but Michael declines, requesting that Andy stop his annoying behavior. Michael's rejection of Andy's offered friendship, combined with Pam and Jim's prank, pushes Andy over the edge.

While at a gas station, Jim gets a call from Pam's mother Helene, who was taking a feverish Cece to see the doctor when she accidentally locked the child in the car. Jim leaves to attend to Cece, but not before attempting in vain to tell Michael through the door of the bathroom; he also tells a guy in coveralls to tell Michael what happened, but the guy is a customer rather than a gas station employee and drives away. Michael is left at the gas station with no way of contacting the office, as his cell phone and wallet are with Jim and he doesn't remember the office's number, so he ends up wandering around Scranton and making stops at a pet store and a hot dog stand.",

Dwight and Erin are rude to Holly, but when Dwight suggests that he walked back to the office, Holly correctly guesses that he went in the direction of the bakery next door \"just for the smell of it\". After stopping at a grocery store to get some things for Pam, Dwight and Erin notice Holly changing cell phone services at a kiosk outside the store. They and the kiosk attendant are annoyed to discover that Holly used a joke name to complete the forms in order to get a rubber stress ball, but when the attendant mentions that someone else had done the exact thing earlier, Dwight and Erin recognize a fake name that is used by Michael. Believing that Holly can subconsciously determine where Michael has been, they follow her to a Chinese restaurant, where they find his picture on the wall along with others who have dined there without paying (Creed also being among them, twice).",

Holly walks away while Dwight decides to look in a bowling alley. Holly heads up to the roof of a tall building to see if she can spot Michael from above. On the roof, she finds Michael who was similarly trying to spot the office from above. They both admit that they've missed each other and kiss.

The office instead decides to use an instant messenger to share quips. Gabe catches them and prints out the list of quips and reads them to the office, which start off insulting Sabre before they attack Gabe personally. The favored entry involves one where one of the dogs says he's going to piss on one of the palm trees because it reminds him of Gabe; an interview reveals that Angela came up with that one. The office continues to get good laughs out of the ones that insult Gabe, who is once again defeated and miserable."

After realizing David is English, Michael tells him about a character he came up with and they immediately begin to tell each other racist jokes about British and Chinese people. When David points out the politically-incorrect nature of their joking, Michael corrects him saying it's just comedy and David agrees, saying, \"Comedy is a place where the mind goes to tickle itself\", then adding Michael's favorite catch phrase \"That's what she said.\" Michael then gives David a hug, and David asks if Dunder Mifflin is hiring. Michael says \"not right now\" and David asks him to drop a line if they do have any openings.",
      "In order to improve his worst-in-office sales totals Andy decides to hold a seminar on starting a small business. He originally enlists Jim to be one of the guest speakers, but Jim abruptly pulls out when he sees one of the audience members and quickly leaves. Seeing Jim leave, the other speakers (Dwight, Phyllis and Stanley) also pull out leaving Andy to replace them with Kevin, Creed and Ryan. Kevin's speech goes bad when he gets ill from running around the room and vomits in front of the audience. Kelly, who replaces Ryan, makes things slightly better when she calls up an old professor from her management training time at Yale (whom she may have slept with) to talk business lessons, but Creed ruins it when he goes into a speech about the Loch Ness Monster.",
      "Erin is trying to beat Gabe in a game of Scrabble. Unfortunately, she's not very good, and the winner of their Scrabble games always picks the movie they watch. Since Gabe has already subjected her to numerous horror movies such as The Shining and The Ring, Erin desperately needs a win. With the help of Oscar and Pam, she almost beats Gabe but loses on the last turn, because she doesn't realize Oscar is trying to feed her a winning word (\"apoplexy\") and instead puts in the word \"ape\".",
      "After Jim spends all day outside of the office, Pam forces him to tell the camera crew why he's avoiding the guy he saw at the seminar. He and the man were childhood friends who were placed in separate reading groups in school (Jim was in the superior one). After his mom told him to hang out with his \"smart\" friends, Jim told his friend that \"mom says you're too dumb to hang out with.\" Jim eventually bumps into the guy in the break room, and tries to laugh off their history, but the guy mocks Jim for not being as successful as his superior intellect would have indicated, and snarks \"Where's your jet pack, Zuckerberg?\"",
      "Back at Andy's seminar, Dwight talks to one of the attendees, a man who owns a golf supply business, and realizes that this could actually be a good opportunity for the sales team. He, along with Phyllis and Stanley, try to rejoin Andy, who refuses at Darryl's prompting. At the end of the seminar, Andy is able to sell three packages, thanks to the advice of Michael, who has taken a Greek persona of \"Mykonos\" in order to impress Holly, who has broken up with AJ. With Holly playing his wife \"Necropolis\", Michael professes his love to her (in character). She amusedly walks away but Michael is hopeful.",
      "At the end of the day, Gabe shows Erin the movie they'll be watching that night, Hardware, which involves a killer robot (calling it a compromise because Erin wanted to watch WALL-E). As he is leaving, a confident Andy, who is still trying to win Erin back, hands her a copy of Shrek 2, leaving Erin visibly pleased."

However, their eagerness is short-lived as they see Danny Cordray, a rival and very successful paper salesman, the best in the Scranton Wilkes-Barre area, has also arrived for a sales pitch. Desperate, Jim and Dwight call in Michael, who is ecstatic at getting a chance to make a sale, to come and try to save them. However, the company ends up taking Danny's offer, even after Michael promises at-cost paper sales and weekend delivery. The trio leaves the client's office and head back home, defeated. It is also revealed by Dwight that Danny had a romantic history with Pam (while Jim was dating Karen), a fact which Pam tries to reiterate to Jim that it was only a brief relationship.",
      "During a brainstorm session, Michael, Jim, and Dwight decide to set up a sting operation to see how Danny is stealing all of their clients and observe his sales techniques. They set up Meredith, as the CEO of Solartech (a fictional company), in Dwight's office, fitted with security cameras, and watch from another room. Danny is then sent in to try to make a sale. All starts well until Meredith attempts to seduce him, forcing Dwight and Jim to send in Oscar and Ryan to save the sting. When Meridith strong arms both of them, a grossed out Michael rushes in to call the whole thing off. Danny becomes infuriated and walks off, but before he leaves the building, Michael offers him a job, mentioning how much money he could make as a traveling salesman for them. He reluctantly accepts the offer, and Michael introduces him as the new salesman to the office. The rest of the sales staff (minus a distracted Andy) act disrespectful towards him, worrying that Danny will take their clients. Michael mentions to them how well sales numbers will go up with Danny a part of the branch now, and that just because he is good doesn't mean he should be turned away. Before Dwight leaves for the day, he viciously insults Danny, then near immediately welcomes him to the company.",

Seeing that Andy is dejected, Kevin and Darryl offer to stay and jam with him for a little extra time, and the trio come up with another, much better song."

Oscar suggests that they replace the copier while Pam suggests they buy new chairs. Jim takes Oscar's side, much to Pam's shock, because he started making copies himself since he and Pam started dating and knows how bad the copier is, while the rest of the employees side with Pam. Toby is the only employee who does not choose a side. He instead suggests that they get the air quality in the office tested saying that there is radon coming from downstairs and asbestos coming from the ceiling, and calls them \"silent killers\", to which Michael replies that Toby is the silent killer. Pam notices the copier malfunctioning when she uses it, but still wants to replace the chairs. Michael feels indifferent about the matter, so both sides start warming up to him to win him over.

      "Angela and Andy visit Schrute Farms to discuss wedding plans with Dwight. Dwight holds a mock wedding in a barn, with Dwight playing Andy and Andy playing Angela's father. A Mennonite minister who only speaks German plays the minister and performs the mock-ceremony. Dwight goes through the steps of the wedding, putting a ring made of twine on Angela's finger and having them both say \"I do\" to each other. Angela appears to be very happy with Dwight and tells him that she made a mistake getting together with Andy. Dwight acknowledges her mistake and tells her that the mock wedding was an actual wedding since Andy technically acted as their witness and the supposedly fake minister was actually marrying them in German. He tells her that this was why he allowed her to have her wedding to Andy on his farm, and she angrily storms off. Back in the office, Angela passionately kisses Andy in front of everybody and tells him that she is going into town to take care of a \"legal issue\" (presumably annulling her marriage to Dwight).",
      "Michael still remains indifferent regarding what to buy, so he brings in a third party: Hank the security guard. However, Hank is more interested in staying in the warm office than making a decision so Michael calls CFO David Wallace to help settle the matter. David informs Michael that he has the option of turning in the surplus, which would result in him getting paid a bonus equal to 15% of it. Michael then tells the employees that he is not going to replace the copier nor the chairs, but Oscar realizes that Michael now knows about the 3rd option (Michael says \"645 dollars\" when Oscar asks him what 15% of 4300 is instead of just saying 645). Michael becomes indecisive again and, unable to take the employees' intrusive behavior anymore, delegates the decision-making to them, hoping that they will be unable to come to a consensus so that he can take the bonus. The employees quickly decide to have the chairs replaced instead of having nothing replaced. Michael is upset because he already bought a fur coat when he expected to receive the bonus from the surplus, and because a group of people threw a bucket of fake blood on his coat when he walked out of the store. Throughout the day, Jim and Pam try to get each other to switch sides. Pam gives Jim a scare, implying that he should switch to her side. Jim later shudders in a talking head spot, amazed at Pam's ultimatum. At the end of the episode, Jim gets back at Pam for getting the chairs replaced by having her make three copies of a document on the copier, initially telling her he is kidding. He then reveals that he actually needs four copies, doing so in the same way Pam had mock threatened him earlier."

To cheer Scarn up, Billy asks a kid to turn on the jukebox to \"The Scarn.\" While all the local drinkers (warehouse workers), Billy, the boy, and the babes all dance to the song, Jim is continually laughing. By the end of the song, the local drunk (Packer) explains that \"if doing the Scarn is gay, then I'm the biggest queer on earth,\" and Jim can't hold in his laughter.",

Everyone says how much they love it and that Michael should enter it in festivals (or carnivals - Kevin), and Michael considers turning it back on. He asks Holly if she liked it, but she is obviously not impressed, and Michael leaves. Back in the office, Michael heads to the Annex where he explains to Holly that if he has no movie, then he has nothing, that nothing is real to him. Holly says that she's real, but Michael tells her that she is a pain in the ass (though apologizes) and heads back to watch the movie with the others.",

Scarn takes the puck and tries to win the game, and Michael explains that this scene was filmed at a real Scranton High School game which they had to forfeit due to interference. Michael leaves the conference room and finds Holly watching through the window. Michael tells Holly that the movie is not good and he leads her back into the screening with him.",
      "Scarn eventually wins the trophy, saves the hostages and kills Goldenface and heads back to his manor where he is feeding himself and Chang (feeding him oil, which reminds Michael that Dwight was a robot). He gets a call from the President asking him to do another mission, to which he replies, \"I'm in.\" After the film, everyone is questioning Scarn's judgment because the President was evil. Dwight says that Scarn was trying to catch the President by joining him, but Michael says that Scarn was being stupid. Stanley then narrates and asks the viewers how he knew so much about Michael Scarn, before revealing Scarn sitting in a chair with Stanley's voice dubbed over him saying, \"because I AM Michael Scarn.\" At the end of the film, the credits roll, showing snapshots of the characters while Andy is singing \"Threat Level: Midnight.\""

Kevin wears his toupee, Jim and Pam believe they have started off well by showing Deangelo pictures of their baby, and Deangelo designates Andy as the office \"funny guy\" when he reveals that he carries name tags around to avoid situations like the one Deangelo and Michael were in.

Deangelo's popularity with the employees causes Michael to get jealous to the point where he passes out peanut butter sandwiches, despite Deangelo's peanut allergy. Deangelo then assembles the staff in the \"multi purpose room\", including Dwight, who learned from Gabe that Michael did not put in a recommendation and thus snubs Michael after being approached as an ally against the new boss. Jim quietly tells Michael that he chose to resign his job and needs to come to terms with both that choice and the fact that life is going to go on at the office. Deangelo then steps out of his meeting and asks Michael for advice on how to run the meeting, saying that he's a good manager and Dunder Mifflin won't be the same without him. The two make up with a reverse hug, Deangelo telling him that he should start enjoying his retirement. Michael returns to his office while Deangelo conducts his meeting in the conference room.",
      "In another effort to impress Deangelo, Jim and Pam bring in Cece, to which Deangelo reacts positively. While they celebrate getting back on his good side, Deangelo reveals to the camera Cece could star in a show called \"Babies I Don't Care About\"."

Jim enters via the break room to hand Stanley a cup of orange juice and on his way to his desk, Andy shows Jim the time on his watch, to which Jim replies with a thumbs up. The entire office seem to go about their usual routine, but not one person is speaking. Jim reveals in a silent Talking Head that the whole office has arranged a challenge of a silent streak that has been going on for fourteen minutes thus far. Dwight receives a call and out of fear of breaking the streak, he picks up the phone and places it back down, refusing to answer and sparking a silent acknowledgement and cheer from his colleagues. In his office, Andy spots a raccoon eating a hamburger in the parking lot and excitedly (and silently) attempts to tell his employees. Kevin opens the wrapper of his candy bar and as he eats it, he exclaims, \"Oh yeah,\" breaking the silent streak. Oscar berates Kevin on his need to vocalize his phrase while Jim proposes that the entire office attempt to beat the record of twenty minutes after they have let out as much speaking as possible. Andy finally informs the office about the raccoon, Dwight tells Jim that the banging of his pen against his desk irritates Dwight, Erin asks the office if a first-aid kit is available for the noticeable cut on her hand and Darryl showcases a new song that he has written. The scene concludes with Jim counting down to restart the silent streak challenge.",
      "Andy, who is worried that he will not be able to meet the 8% quarterly sales growth figures that Robert California asked for by $830, starts to think of creative ways to sell more paper. During a conference room meeting, he proposes that everyone in the office buy paper to alleviate some of the burden, but no one is willing. He then decides to ask Oscar to make a rounding mistake in the books, but Oscar tells Andy that he does not have time to make the mistake because he is leaving for a trivia contest in a bar in Philadelphia. He tells Andy that the prize is $1000 and his team is determined to win it. Andy, encouraged by Darryl and Jim, decides to take the entire office to Philadelphia in an attempt to win the money and make up the sales growth difference. At the bar, which turns out to be a gay bar called the Liberty Well, Andy divides the office into three teams: Dunder Mifflin A-Team (Jim, Darryl, Andy, and Ryan), Dunder-Mifflin B-Team (Stanley, Phyllis, Creed, and Cathy), and the \"Just For Fun\" team (Kevin, Kelly, Erin, and Meredith). Oscar refuses to join Andy and stays on his original team. Initially, the Dunder Mifflin A-Team does well until they soon falter. However, much to Andy's surprise, the \"Just For Fun\" team (calling themselves The Einsteins) ends up doing much better than expected because of the group's trivial knowledge on a variety of issues. Humorously, the team misses the answers to a handful of common questions, including one about their namesake. They make it to the final round against Oscar's team and eventually win thanks to Kevin's correct answers. However, the Just for Fun team's luck runs out when they later get demolished while trying to win another bar's even more lucrative trivia contest.",
      "Dwight heads down to Florida to meet with Robert California at the Sabre headquarters to discuss a possible manager position. While sitting in the waiting room, Dwight talks to Gabe, who describes himself as the \"toilet of the company\" who flushes all the unwanted items away. Robert then tells Dwight that he cannot meet with him but will have him meet with Bill, another executive, much to Dwight's frustration. However, Robert manipulates the situation by secretly calling Gabe and instructing him to not let Dwight speak with Bill either, but to have Gabe listen to Dwight's pitch and then reject him. Dwight, after being told by Gabe that he is not wanted as a manager, grabs and twists Gabe's arm and forces him to be taken to Robert's Florida condo. Initially, Robert tries to spare Dwight's feelings, but eventually turns him down by telling him he's a better salesman and his drive and energy would be wasted in a manager's position. Dwight then returns to Scranton."

      "Michael's group outing to the mall comes as he is beginning to openly doubt his relationship with Jan, having received an aggressive \"booty call\" from her earlier that day (which her assistant Hunter dutifully agreed to put on her schedule). Over lunch at the food court, Michael eventually starts \"dishing\" about his romance with Jan, after his attempt to prod them into gossiping yields awkward silence. (Angela abruptly leaves, mostly out of moral outrage, but also to special order clothes for her embarrassingly undersized frame.)",
      "The women encourage him to weigh the pros and cons of his relationship. During the exercise he slowly reveals, with noticeable unease and shame, that Jan is sexually controlling in ways that humiliate him. Karen tries to give Michael reasons to stay and work things out with Jan. Pam insists that his relationship with Jan is unhealthy; an open rivalry between Karen and Pam begins to brew. Finally, Michael flatly states that he's not happy around Jan, and the women convince him that this particular \"con\" outweighs all of the \"pros.\"",
      "Pam is visibly pleased that her intuition won out over Karen's. To thank them for their advice, Michael treats the women to one item each at Victoria's Secret. Karen buys some sexy lingerie for her and Jim's six-month anniversary (which a depressed Pam sees as she buys a fuzzy bathrobe, which she plans to cut up into towels).",
      "with the women out of the office, Kevin decides it is time to fulfill his fantasy of entering a women's bathroom. He discovers a plush waiting room inside. Later, while Kevin, Jim, Ryan, and Toby hang out in the women's room, Creed enters, and it is revealed that he uses the women's room to \"go number two\" (but has been caught and has had to pay for it). Ryan sheepishly admits to Jim that he'd asked Karen out, via e-mail, in the past.",
      "Jim, visibly caught off-guard, recovers and replies that Karen had already read it to him, and that \"she liked him as a friend.\"",
      "On the way back from the mall, Meredith's minivan breaks down, and Michael is unable to change the tire. Pam steps in and changes it herself. Upon returning to the office, Michael decides to call Jan and end their relationship. When he gets her voicemail, he leaves a message telling her he wants them to \"go on a little break, permanently.\" Before he can finish the message, Jan walks into his office, and Michael hangs up the phone, pretending he was speaking with a friend.",
      "Jan tells Michael that she feels badly about their earlier conversation, so she drove all the way from New York City to personally apologize. Michael, seeming touched but confused, accepts her apology. Her cell phone then buzzes, and Jan is initially pleased to see that she has a voicemail from Michael. Despite Michael's protests, she listens to it immediately. When she hears the message she hangs up the phone; looking hurt, she leaves Michael's office without a word.",
      "The episode ends with Jim giving Dwight a tip on the identity of the flasher. Jim tells him that he saw the pervert above the sink in the women's bathroom. Dwight storms into the bathroom, where a mustache has been drawn on one of the mirrors. Upon seeing his reflection line up with the mustache, Dwight realizes he was duped by Pam."

      "Andy presents the office staff a video compilation of the team's softball season. While the staff are initially excited they soon realize it is Andy's horrible attempt to engage in the internet craze of making a \"fail video\". The video consists of the staff doing whatever was considered normal and Andy making vulgar noises over it. In retaliation Jim pulls up a video of Andy trying to carry the full water cooler, which ends with Andy falling down and spilling the water all over himself. The office staff begin to chant \"Fail! Fail!\" at Andy to which he eventually gets angry and leaves.",
      "Toby and Erin are testing for electromagnetic field hotspots around the office due to non-insulated wiring and they find many spots, which they mark with red tape. Dwight scoffs at needing to insulate the wires, stating that he refuses to do so because it is too costly.",
      "Jim is being extremely nice to Pam due to her being supportive of Jim wanting to go to Philadelphia to work with his friend on their new business. He is looking for a way to pay her back.",
      "Nellie is looking eagerly to fulfill her lifelong dream of adopting a child. She asks Andy if he is willing to help her out by writing a character reference, but Andy rejects her, still hating her for what she did to him.",
      "The office staff are still angry at Dwight for caring more about money than about their own safety. Dwight argues that in order to insulate the wires they would have to open the walls and close the office building down for a week. Pam makes a comment about how she would love a week off work and Jim immediately sets off to work on achieving this. He puts a popcorn bag in the microwave and only pops one kernel before placing it under Dwight's desk. He achieves making Dwight believe the electromagnetic radiation caused it to occur and finally scares Dwight when Jim tells him it may cause infertility.",
      "Jim believes he got them a week off work, but Dwight reveals he has gotten them a new workspace for the week, a bus. The office staff find it cramped and uncomfortable. Erin learns of Nellie wanting to adopt a child, and having been a foster kid herself, offers to help Nellie write her letter.",
      "Jim, having failed at getting Pam a week off work, decides to cheer her up by convincing Dwight to drive the bus to LaVerne's pie stand, Pam's favorite pie shop. Dwight refuses at first but after convincing Andy and the rest of the office staff Dwight is forced to do so. The bus drives off, leaving Clark and Darryl behind but they don't seem to mind in the least.",
      "While the bus drives along it picks up a hitchhiker, Creed, who smiles and loudly announces that he is playing hooky from work, before realizing that the entire office staff is on the bus.",
      "Nellie submits her letter to Andy, and he loudly and rudely tells Nellie how poorly written the letter is and how her dream will never come true. Nellie quietly goes to the front of the bus and behind a curtain. Erin has clearly heard this as well.",
      "Dwight decides to stop the bus, as he is tired of being pushed around by Jim. The fact that Philip was not his child has been gnawing away at him, and he climbs out the emergency exit door in the roof and goes off to sulk. Pam notices this is uncharacteristic of Dwight and tells Jim to go find out if he is okay.",
      "After some awkward conversation about how Dwight is sad that he is still childless after all this time he eventually comes to the realization that the office staff are kind of like his children. Jim is finally able to convince him to go to the pie stand.",
      "Andy hears who he believes to be Nellie sobbing behind the curtain and jokes with Pete about British women being over-emotional, but Pete remarks, \"I don't think that's Nellie.\" It's revealed that Erin is crying from what Andy said about the letter and Nellie is comforting her.",
      "Jim and Pam make up while eating pie and Kevin tries to get Oscar to hit him in the face with his pie and Oscar eventually does. Andy feels terrible about what he said and adds a few sentences to Nellie's letter about how she would make a wonderful mother and signs it.",
      "Once back at the office building, Andy insists they keep playing the games they played while on the road and annoys the office staff with his constant singing and banjo playing."
