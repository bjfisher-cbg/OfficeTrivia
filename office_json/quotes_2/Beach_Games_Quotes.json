I will answer your question with a question. It's like what happens to a chicken when you take its head away. It dies. Unless you find a new head. I need to see which one of these people have the skills to be a chicken head."},{"type":"paragraph","text":"Michael: Jim Halpert. Pros: smart, cool, good-looking - remind you of anybody you know? Cons? Not a hard worker - I can spend all day on a project, and he will finish the same project in a half an hour, so that should tell you something...Dwight is an obvious candidate for my job. He has the best sales record in the office, he loves the work - he is, however, an idiot...I'm also considering Stanley, because of all the good that black people have done, for America...Andy Bernard. Pros: he's classy, he gets me, he went to Cornell, I trust him. Cons? I don't really trust him."},{"type":"paragraph","text":"Stanley: I would rather work for an upturned broom, with a bucket for a head, than work with somebody else in this office besides myself - game on!"},{"type":"paragraph","text":"Oscar: If either of these guys are put in charge of the office, I will transfer to Albany. Gil can come if he wants - I'm kind of looking for a way out of that relationship anyway. I think I might try girls for a while - Angela thinks I can cross over."},{"type":"paragraph","text":"Pam: Jim, I called off my wedding because of you...and now we're not even friends. And things are just, like, weird between us, and that sucks! And I miss you! You were my best friend before you went to Stamford, and I really miss you."}],"images":[]}]}
