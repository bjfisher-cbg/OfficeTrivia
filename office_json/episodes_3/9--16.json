After attempting to fire Pete, Andy is lectured by both Erin and Pete to move on. Seeking revenge, Andy hires both Alice, Pete's ex-girlfriend and Gabe Lewis, who is still attracted to Erin, in order to make Pete and Erin feel uncomfortable. The plan inevitably works as the new couple's past relationship issues surface with Gabe making several uncomfortable remarks and Alice bringing up Pete's immature past, prompting arguments to break out in the conference room. Andy smugly tells the camera that seeing Erin and Pete unhappy makes him feel better."

Toby believes he may be innocent, but he is proven wrong when he is nearly strangled to death in prison. However, he does have his spirits lifted after Nellie gives him a lift from the hospital and commends him for his bravery. During the last scene of the show, Oscar queues up a television show on his computer, and while the ad loads, he tries to do gravity boot sit-ups. While he is struggling to get down, the camera pans over to Oscar's computer and zooms in on an upcoming television guide on his screen that reveals that the in-series documentary—called The Office: An American Workplace—will air in May."
