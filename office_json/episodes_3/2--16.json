        "Michael spends Valentine's Day at \"Corporate\" in New York City, which he describes as Scranton \"on steroids.\" Before the meeting with the new CFO begins, Michael spills the beans to the other branch managers that he and Jan \"hooked up.\" The CFO and Jan arrive, and the presentation of Josh Porter (Stamford) goes well. Michael shows a video titled \"The Faces of Scranton\" before reluctantly providing the financial information of the Scranton branch. Craig (\"Craiggers\") from the Albany branch is completely unprepared and attempts to cover for it by suggesting that \"maybe I should've slept with [Jan], too.\"",
        "Meanwhile, Angela gives Dwight a bobblehead doll of himself for Valentine’s Day, which he proclaims is the best gift he’s ever received. After consulting with Pam for advice, he gives Angela a key, presumably to his beet ranch home; she is visibly touched by this. Phyllis is inundated with gifts from her boyfriend Bob Vance, Vance Refrigeration, while Pam is irritated with Roy when the only thing he gives her for Valentine's Day is the promise of the \"best sex of [her] life.\" Jim is forced to witness Ryan turning Kelly down for a date after they hooked up the previous night.",
        "In a private conversation with Michael, Jan is convinced that her career is over, but Michael assures her that he will \"fix it.\" In an unusual moment of tact, Michael defuses the situation by explaining to the CFO that the whole thing was a bad joke (which Craig stupidly misinterpreted as the truth) and accepts responsibility for the situation. Jan plays along by accepting Michael's apology and agreeing to drop the matter. Before Michael leaves, Jan catches Michael by the elevator and kisses him, but groans when she realizes they were caught on camera."
