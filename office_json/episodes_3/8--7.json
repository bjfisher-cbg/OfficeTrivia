        "In the cold open, Andy tries to impress a potential client by pretending to turn down an \"important phone call,\" when in fact it is really a made-up ruse being aided by Erin. However, Erin describes the fake phone call in depth with the \"death\" of Andy's mother, prompting the potential client to urge Andy to take the call (helped along with concern from a knowing Dwight). After pretending to talk to the \"police\" on the phone (actually Darryl, who is reluctantly part of the ruse), a humiliated and embarrassed Andy tells Erin to leave the room and \"hold all other calls\".",
        "Pam trains an attractive temporary worker, Cathy Simms, so that she can take her place when she goes on maternity leave. Pam asks Jim if he finds the new temp attractive. Jim, not wanting to upset his pregnant wife, tells her that he does not find her replacement attractive at all. However, Pam is convinced that Jim is lying to her (even after reassurance from the rest of the staff), and she enlists the help of the harshly honest Dwight to prove that Jim finds the new temp attractive. After a battery of tests (including an embarrassing show of Dwight reaching for Jim's crotch to search for an erection), Dwight and Pam convince Jim to go get his blood pressure checked, as a means of a lie-detector test. As Dwight's homemade lie-detector test fails, Pam realizes that Jim has unusually high blood pressure, which his father also suffers from, and forgets about the issue in order to focus on her husband's health.",
        "Meanwhile, CEO Robert California surprises Andy, Kevin, and Darryl when he asks to join their band after he finds them having a jam session in the warehouse. Soon thereafter, California's friends, skilled musicians themselves, arrive and take over the original band. Andy, Kevin and Darryl, with the help of warehouse worker Val, realize that they were ousted, and after a failed attempt to try getting their original band roles back, they instead satisfyingly jam outside by themselves."
