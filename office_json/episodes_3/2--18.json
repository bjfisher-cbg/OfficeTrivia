        "It is \"Take Your Daughter To Work Day\" at Dunder Mifflin Scranton, which Michael laments, as he feels he's not good with kids. Toby and Stanley bring their daughters (Sasha and Melissa respectively), Kevin brings his fianc√©e's daughter Abby, and Meredith brings her son Jake. Pam is determined to become one child's friend by the end of the day. Michael starts to win over Toby's daughter Sasha when she visits him in his office. Stanley's daughter develops a crush on Ryan, but a jealous Kelly alerts Stanley, leading him to reprimand Ryan for his \"motives\". Jim makes friends with Kevin's future step-daughter, who asks Jim over for dinner. However, Jim declines because he has a date, presumably Brenda from the Booze Cruise.",
        "Michael shows the office his childhood appearance on the kid's show, Fundle Bundle, where he revealed his childhood dream was to \"get married and have 100 kids, so I can have 100 friends, and no one can say 'no' to being my friend.\" He becomes depressed and retreats into his office when the children remind him that he never achieved that dream (or anything resembling it). Toby then talks to him and Michael decides to start online dating (with the unfortunate username of \"LittleKidLover\"). After tormenting Dwight all day (and calling him \"Mr. Poop\"), Meredith's son is insulted by him, much to Angela's pleasure. Pam ends up winning over Meredith's son with the paper shredder. Jim leaves the pizza party early to go on a date, to Pam's chagrin. Michael and Dwight end the party with their duet of Crosby, Stills, Nash & Young's \"Teach Your Children\"."
