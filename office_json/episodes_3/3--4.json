    "storylines": [
        "Michael feigns walking descending a staircase behind a stack of paper boxes under the guise of retrieving a pencil \"from the warehouse\" for a reluctant Ryan. An overzealous Dwight prompts a second go-around of the joke, and Pam keeps the joke alive, pleading for a cup of coffee, which Michael crawls to the breakroom to retrieve. In an interview, he likens himself to Bette Midler in For the Boys: \"Gotta keep the troops entertained.\" Upon his return crawl, Pam requests cream and sugar in her coffee of her now-exhausted boss.",
        "Michael flips through his Rolodex and starts to flirt with Jan on the phone after she tells him \"We've lost Ed Truck.\" He is shaken to learn Jan hasn't lost a contact number, but that the former Scranton branch manager has died. Kelly and Phyllis console Michael after he breaks the news to a mostly unmoved staff. He announces he'll be in his office for consolation pop-ins, but with no takers he wanders to the reception desk and engulfs Pam in an awkward too-long hug, telling her Truck was \"almost 70, so ... circle of life.\"",
        "Meanwhile at a staff meeting in Stamford, Karen irritates Josh when she neglects to compile a supply list for Fairfield County Schools. She is angered when Josh asks Jim to ensure she completes the task. Jim agrees and Andy calls him a suck-up in a barely disguised cough. In the Stamford breakroom, Karen is dismayed to learn the vending machine is out of salt and vinegar Herr's potato chips, and turns her meeting room ire on a friendly Jim, telling him her snack food needs do not fall under his authority. He counters that he does have that power, and no work shall be completed until the chips she requires are procured.",
        "Michael makes a comment on Creed's age, but the mood changes when Creed mentions Truck was decapitated after flying down Route 6, drunk as a skunk and sliding his vehicle beneath an 18-wheeler. Dwight steals Michael's thunder with a blunt announcement of the latest news. Dwight receives only disgust from his \"Monkey\" when he asks her to pack his decapitated head on ice should that fate ever befall him. In an interview, Dwight explains he would like to be frozen, even in pieces, so that he may one day be reanimated with the knowledge to avoid the same death in the future.",
        "On speakerphone with Jan, Michael laments the fact that the staff receives a whole day off in honor of Martin Luther King, Jr., \"and he didn't even work here.\" On his desk is a decade-old Dunder Mifflin newsletter with a full-color photo of Truck and a mulleted Michael above a headline reading \"Michael Scott achieves top sales honors for Third straight quarter.\" In lieu of a day off, Michael suggests a full-size statue of Truck with illuminated eyes and mobile arms. Jan finds the idea unrealistic and hangs up, but an ever-resourceful Dwight prepares a schematic of a 2/3 size Truck robot with a six-foot extension cord in case it were to gain self-awareness and turn against the staff.",
        "Back in Stamford, Jim phones potential chip sources as Karen prepares to give up the search. Gentle taunting lures her back in as she assures him \"I am not a quitter.\" The pair mock Andy when he tries to horn in on their activity via inane suggestion.",
        "Michael disgusts some employees by imagining the bloodbath Truck endured when his \"cappa was de-tated ... from his head.\" He summons the staff to a primitive grief counseling session involving a collapsible Hoberman Sphere ball. Expounding on his feeling at the loss of his beloved ex-boss, he says it \"feels like my heart has been dropped into a bucket of boiling tears and someone else is hitting my soul in the crotch with a frozen sledgehammer and a third guy is punching me in the griefbone, but no one hears me because I'm terribly, terribly alone.\"",
        "Roy pulls Pam from the session under the pretense of addressing a problem with her car. In the parking lot, Pam and Roy have a banal chat about her car's airbags and he asks if she's \"still driving too fast.\" Upon her return to the grief session, she finds Michael had put the whole thing on hold because \"we wait for a family member.\" Stanley refuses to play Michael's grief game but Dwight gladly tells the group he resorbed another fetus while still in the womb, making him as strong as a man combined with a baby. Pam, Ryan, and Kevin tell progressively implausible stories based on movie plots, angering Michael when he realizes what they are doing.",
        "Toby tells Michael death is a part of life, and uses an example of a bird that flew into a Dunder Mifflin first-floor window that morning. Mortified that Toby did not investigate the bird's health, Michael charges outside, picks up the deceased animal and attempts to resuscitate it via mouth-to-mouth, rebuking Dwight's pleas to drop the germ-ridden being.",
        "When attempts to revive the bird fail, Michael schedules a 4 p.m. parking lot funeral for the bird and putting the kibosh on office productivity for the day, despite staff telling him that they all still have a lot of work to complete. Dwight breaks off the bird's beak in an attempt to stuff it through the pop-tab of an empty soda can. In an interview he comments on the resourcefulness of farm-dwellers such as himself and reveals his grandfather was reburied in an oil drum.",
        "Pam fashions a makeshift coffin and reads a prepared speech that comforts Michael. She mentions that although the bird was an unknown among the staff, it surely did not die alone as it had the company of other birds, and likely wanted to get into Dunder Mifflin Scranton in order to serenade the staff with a song. Michael is noticeably moved from the speech as his eyes well with tears. Dwight interrupts her to state that the deceased was \"not a songbird.\" Pam accompanies Dwight who plays \"On the Wings of Love\" on his recorder. The coffin is placed in a box of shredded paper and set afire.",
        "Karen finds a bag of Herr's on her desk and, in a voiceover, Jim says he traced the chips from the manufacturer to the distributor to the vending machine company to an adjacent office building.",
        "Dwight extinguishes and stomps out the funeral pyre and coffin before ordering warehouse employees to \"get a broom, mush.\""
