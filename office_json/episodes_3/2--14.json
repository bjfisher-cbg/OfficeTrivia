        "When someone deposits a malodorous substance on the carpet in Michael's office, he spends the day at Jim's desk, relegating Jim to a back room with Kelly. Michael institutes a sales contest, promising $100 (which later turns out to be $83) to the person who racks up the most sales that day.",
        "At his temporary new desk, Jim suffers Kelly's constant chattering. She asks Jim to hook her up with Ryan. Jim continues to yearn for Pam, but her fiancé, Roy, is in the office replacing the carpet along with Darryl, and Jim is unable to speak with her. Interestingly, while exiled in the back of the room, Jim makes an awkward (but later revealed to be a successful) attempt to ask Brenda, who joined the office on the Booze Cruise, out on a date.  As the day wears on, Michael becomes convinced that what happened to his office is a hate crime and an act of terrorism. Believing it to be done by someone in the office, he begins to lose his faith in his employees, who he considers his \"friends\". But his mood changes drastically when he finds out the object in his office was actually left there by his \"Best Friend Forever,\" Todd Packer. Michael instantly finds the joke hilarious, and his faith in his friends is restored. It is never revealed what the substance Todd left on the carpet is, but it can be seen in one shot, and it appears to be feces of some sort.",
        "At the end of the day, Jim is seen looking rather unhappy as he notices some unheard voicemails. He looks at the blinking light for a few seconds and decides to listen to all seven unheard voicemails, all left by Pam throughout the day. As we listen to the voicemails, Jim leaves work with a noticeable smile on his face."
