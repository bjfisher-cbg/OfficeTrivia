        "Jim convinces Dwight that he needs to choose someone to act as an Assistant to the Assistant to the Regional Manager (A.A.R.M.); the two subsequently hold tryouts for the position. The tryouts consist of several office-oriented challenges and it is found, through Jim's scheming, that Dwight is the most qualified for the newly founded A.A.R.M. position. Angela is forced to bring her son, Phillip, to work, after her daycare turns her child away. Dwight, who initially wanted to marry his current girlfriend Esther, begins to think that Angela's son is actually his. He confronts her, but she tells him that this is not the case. Dwight then confers with Jim, who tells Dwight that if he truly loves Angela then that's who he should pursue. Dwight makes up his mind and proposes to Angela, who says yes. Angela finally reveals to Dwight that Phillip is indeed his son.",
        "Meanwhile, Darryl returns to Scranton, after quietly quitting a week ago to work full-time at Athlead, the sports marketing company that Jim founded. When the others spot him, they are upset that he left without saying goodbye and demand to spend some time with him one way or another before he leaves for good. The office ultimately decides on one final dance together.",
        "When Darryl runs into Pam, he tells her about Athlead's success and how Jim is missing out by staying in Scranton. Pam begins to worry that she is making Jim do something that he does not want to do. She later confronts her husband and admits that she thinks she might not be enough for him; he tries to tell her that she is the most important thing in his life. Later, he decides to get the documentary crew's help; the crew makes a DVD of many of the highlights of Jim and Pam's relationship throughout the series. The final scene is from the second season Christmas episode \"Christmas Party\" in which Jim gives Pam a teapot as a gift, but takes back his very emotional note that expresses his feelings for Pam before she notices it. After the DVD plays, Jim presents Pam with the actual, unopened note. She reads it, and the two happily embrace.",
        "Meanwhile, Andy auditions for America's Next A Cappella Sensation. Andy meets an exuberant and like-minded lady, Casey Dean from Cincinnati, Ohio. However, before he is able to tryout in front of the judges—who include Aaron Rodgers, Clay Aiken, and Santigold—the auditions close, and Andy makes a fool of himself. Dejected, he journeys to Poor Richard's Pub, where he meets up with the rest of his former office workers. Altogether, the office watches the official airing of the documentary on PBS' Scranton affiliate station, WVIA-TV. As the office workers stare at the screen, the audience hears the opening dialogue from the series' first episode, \"Pilot\"."
