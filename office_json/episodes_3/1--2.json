        "Michael explains in his talking head that it's Diversity Day and that a guest speaker is at Dunder Mifflin Scranton to talk about diversity in the workplace. Michael claims that he's wanted this for awhile. Corporate mandated it without Michael having to talk to them about it, though. But Michael still believes it's very important.",
        "Jim is trying to make a sales call when Dwight begins noisily shredding paper. Jim turns off Dwight's surge strip. In retaliation, Dwight disconnects Jim's phone call. Jim explains to the camera that this client makes up 25% of his commission each year. He brings a small bottle of champagne to the office with him to celebrate.",
        "While Pam plays freecell, Michael walks out of his office, then backs up when he sees the corporate representative is heading out of the conference room. He makes sure to walk out at the same time as the other man and make a point of singling out Oscar Martinez as a friend of his. Jim has made contact with his client just in time for Michael to order him into the meeting. Jim is forced to hang up again.",
        "When the meeting begins, Michael tries to take over by talking about how he doesn't even see Stanley as a black man. The representative explains that's not the point here. No one is expected to be color-blind. That's just fighting ignorance with more ignorance.",
        "Then Michael decides everyone should go around and name an ethnicity that he or she finds sexually attractive. Dwight claims he's attracted to whites and Indians. The representative does not think that's a good start. He asks Michael for permission to run this session himself and suggests it would be easier if Michael sits down.",
        "He explains that he asked each of them to write down an incident that offended them. He would like volunteers to assist him. Dwight asks that they don't do anything involving gays.",
        "The representative attempts to take control again from Michael who asks his name. When he reveals that it's Mr. Brown, Michael thinks it's a trick to see if he will call a black man Mr. Brown. Brown assures him that is his name. He goes on to explain that almost everyone wrote down the same incident and asks if everyone is familiar with the Chris Rock routine.",
        "Michael complains to the camera how Chris Rock can do a hilarious routine that makes everyone laugh, but he gets in trouble from corporate when he does the same routine. Michael volunteers to be the joker, Brown doesn't want the person who was the original offender in the same position. Kevin offers to be the joke teller, but doesn't tell it to Michael's liking. Michael interrupts with a loud, profane rendition of the routine before Brown stops him.",
        "While Jim listens to his phone ring, helpless to answer it, Brown sets up an acronym for Hero: Honesty, Empathy, Respect and Open-Mindedness. Dwight adds additional criteria that essentially describes a super-hero, not a hero. Brown passes out forms, asking everyone sign it. Michael refuses because he didn't learn anything.",
        "Privately, Brown explains that they both know he is here because of Michael's behavior. Michael argues that this office is racially advanced enough that it really doesn't need a diversity lecture. Brown tells him it does because it's Michael that caused the need for it. He only needs Michael's signature, but put the whole office through the seminar because he didn't want Michael to feel singled out. Michael feigns offense that this wasn't really about diversity then.",
        "Michael signs the form and then jokes after the fact that he signed it \"Daffy Duck\".",
        "In the meantime, Jim has tried to call back his client and has to leave a message.",
        "Michael comes out, tears up the pledge, and criticizes Mr. Brown's lack of an \"Oprah moment\". He wants everyone to get as much done before lunch as possible.",
        "Jim gets nothing but a busy signal right before Michael forces them all into the conference room again.",
        "The HR representative, Toby Flenderson asks if they are going to sit Indian style. Michael orders him out for being offensive. Then he shows the staff a video announcing his new initiative for Diversity Tomorrow and quotes Abraham Lincoln as saying, \"If you are a racist, I will attack you with the North\".",
        "Kelly Kapoor, a young Indian woman, asks to be excused for a customer meeting. Michael lets her go. He introduces himself and describes his ethnic breakdown, including that he is part Native American. Oscar asks him what part he is. Michael asks about Oscar's ethnicity. Oscar explains his parents were born in Mexico, moved here and he was born. Michael wants to know if there's something he would like to be called besides Mexican. Oscar doesn't understand why Michael would think Mexican is offensive.",
        "Jim, hearing his phone ring, runs out to grab it, but is too late.",
        "Michael hands out cards with different ethnicities on them. The employees are to take a card and then try to guess their pretend ethnicity by how their co-workers treat them.",
        "Stanley is inadvertently given Black. Dwight is Asian but can't guess it based upon people telling him they like his people's food or eat lots of rice. Michael, who's chosen Martin Luther King for himself, insists Pam stir up the pot by getting extreme. Pam hesitantly suggests to Dwight that his people aren't very good drivers. Dwight angrily asks if he's a woman.",
        "Jim goes to Pam's desk where Ryan is watching an online sketch. Ryan mentions how cute she is. Jim agrees, but that Pam is engaged. Ryan says he was talking about the girl in the sketch.",
        "Kevin is Italian and is trying to get Angela to guess that she's Jamaican by using the word \"mon\" and talking about beaches. Angela won't go any further when he asks if she wants to get high.",
        "Irritated that no one is trying very hard to be offensive, Michael immediately jumps on Kelly when she returns from her meeting by throwing himself into a really offensive Indian stereotype until Kelly slaps him. Michael gets visibly upset. He tells the employees how now Kelly knows what it's like to be a minority.",
        "Jim finally gets ahold of his client who was able to close his sale with Dwight instead who gave him a discount. Jim puts the mini champagne bottle on Dwight's desk.",
        "Michael continues mumbling about Mr. Brown and corrects Stanley on how to pronounce the word collard in collard greens. When 5 PM arrives, Pam is asleep on Jim's shoulder. He smiles at the camera, then wakes her up so they can go.",
        "He tells the camera that today was a pretty good day."
