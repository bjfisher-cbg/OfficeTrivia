    "storylines": [
        "The office gets a box of printer supplies from Sabre (pronounced 'Say-ber'). Michael thinks it is for him and distributes the items around the office. However, it is for Gabe Lewis, new director of sales (Jan Levinson, Ryan Howard and Charles Miner's former jobs). When Michael realizes this, he tries to put everything back in the box. Everyone works hard and they manage to pack it all away, however Michael accidentally leaves his cell phone in the box and they have to unpack it all again.",
        "Erin and Andy, assuming that Sabre is pronounced 'Saab-ray', sing a song for Gabe titled \"Dunder Mifflin Is A Part Of Sabre\" to the tune of Miley Cyrus's \"Party In The USA\". Gabe takes a video of the song, however, when 'Sabre' is repeatedly mispronounced, he shuts off his cell phone. Meanwhile, Andy and Erin continue to drop hints that they like each other with both oblivious to the other's advances.",
        "In the conference room, Gabe shows everyone a promotional video for Sabre, featuring Christian Slater. Michael and the rest of the office learn about Sabre's new policies. He is outraged that sites like YouTube and Twitter are blocked and that he will now be asked to drink out of a metal container rather than waste a huge amount of plastic cups. Gabe also pushes the idea that Sabre is primarily a printer company and that Dunder Mifflin will be a printer company which also sells paper.",
        "Michael asks Gabe to talk to someone higher up in the company. Gabe talks to CEO Jo Bennett, a stubborn no-nonsense boss who tells Michael to think hard about his future at Dunder Mifflin. It is clear she has no problem telling him off.",
        "Meanwhile, Pam and Jim try to get into a highly rated daycare center for their unborn baby. They arrive early for their interview and take the time to admire the facility. However, Jim walks into a children's bathroom to find a man sitting on the toilet and becomes embarrassed, before telling Pam about it. Jim and Pam have the meeting with Jerry, the daycare guy (who, it emerges, Jim had earlier walked in on the toilet). He doesn't seem to like Jim and Pam and tells them that they may not get in.",
        "Pam, finally, asks the guy if his problem is about Jim walking in on him in the bathroom, and Jerry awkwardly tries to defend himself. The meeting does not appear to end well.",
        "Michael visits a newly unemployed David Wallace, who is at home with his wife Rachel and their son. Their son plays drums loudly while David makes Michael a marshmallow fluff sandwich. David seems to have crashed, much like Jan Levinson after she was fired. David and Michael sit in the outdoor hot tub and Michael asks David how to deal with his problems with Sabre, however David is unable to come to Michael's rescue. They talk about David's future and David asks Michael if he would like to become involved with an idea called Suck It, a vacuum that sucks toys up.",
        "Michael shares with the documentary crew that he dislikes the new David and leaves.",
        "Back at Dunder Mifflin, Michael brings in some orange juice for the office to drink out of their containers. He then makes a speech saying he thinks the relationship with Sabre will be a successful one."
