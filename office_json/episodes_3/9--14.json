In a talking head interview Pam expresses that she feels no one's there to help her, and feels alone. The boom mic then taps her on the head and Pam smiles. Distraught, she seeks the help of Dwight and Nellie, who both eagerly help her track down the vandal. The three eventually find out that the criminal was a warehouse worker named Frank. Pam and Dwight take revenge by painting childish pictures on his beloved truck with washable paint. However, Frank overreacts and begins to show signs that he is going to physically assault Pam. Brian, the documentary crew's boom mic operator, breaks protocol and intervenes by hitting the warehouse employee across the face with his mic. In the end, the audience learns that both Frank and Brian have been fired from Dunder Mifflin and the documentary, respectively. As Brian leaves, he tells Pam that he will always be there for her if she needs someone."

Oscar, who believes he is invited because he thinks Robert is in love with him, soon realizes that he was only invited to boost Robert's opinion in the polls among Latino voters. After the party Kevin thanks Angela and Robert for the food, but tells Robert that he is a terrible person for using his friends to gain political support."

In a talking head interview Pam expresses that she feels no one's there to help her, and feels alone. The boom mic then taps her on the head and Pam smiles. Distraught, she seeks the help of Dwight and Nellie, who both eagerly help her track down the vandal. The three eventually find out that the criminal was a warehouse worker named Frank. Pam and Dwight take revenge by painting childish pictures on his beloved truck with washable paint. However, Frank overreacts and begins to show signs that he is going to physically assault Pam. Brian, the documentary crew's boom mic operator, breaks protocol and intervenes by hitting the warehouse employee across the face with his mic. In the end, the audience learns that both Frank and Brian have been fired from Dunder Mifflin and the documentary, respectively. As Brian leaves, he tells Pam that he will always be there for her if she needs someone.",
