        "Dwight and Todd Packer compete to become VP under Nellie Bertram by seducing her after work at the hotel bar. For most of the night, Packer seems to be the most successful. Dwight has to leave the bar momentarily and he enlists Gabe to keep an eye on Packer and Nellie. Gabe takes it upon himself to spike Packer's beer with his asthma inhaler, which causes Packer to vomit and leaves Dwight alone with Nellie. Dwight eventually succeeds in seducing Nellie as she asks for a key to his room. Dwight scratches off the magnetic strip on his hotel card before giving it to Nellie, stating the seduction was only to gain approval and that he doesn't intend to have sex with her.",
        "Andy has everyone stay late to cover for their co-workers in Florida, which turns into an awkward situation when Val's boyfriend, Brandon, arrives and accuses Darryl of having an affair with her, after having read Darryl's text messages to her. Kelly demands that Darryl read them aloud since it provides something interesting to happen during the long night. They eventually agree that his text messages are suggestive of Darryl wanting to be with Val, but both of them brush it off as being ridiculous. Pam suggests that he try a bold step and he does, privately telling Val that a potential relationship is not ridiculous.",
        "Erin confides in Ryan that she's intending to stay in Tallahassee. Ryan interprets this as an attempt to hook up with him so he attempts to seduce her by taking her to the kitchen to help her make a waffle. They end up hiding under a table when the chefs come back. After Ryan compliments Erin, she suggests that they could become roommates in Florida and possibly start dating in six months if things go well between them. Not wanting that long timeline, he resorts to saying he loves Kelly.",
        "Meanwhile, Jim has started spending more time with Cathy because the adulterous and lecherous actions of Stanley made Jim uncomfortable around him. Things become awkward when Cathy wants to spend time with him in his room. When Jim gets really uncomfortable with her, he calls Dwight saying he has bed bugs and asks him for help. Dwight arrives and forces Cathy off the bed, making Jim think she will leave, but she steps into the bathroom to take a shower instead. Dwight leaves before Cathy gets out of the shower and she comes out wearing a bath robe.",
        "After ordering some desserts from room service and showing off her legs to Jim, he finally says that he's happily married, and doesn't want to be with her. Cathy gets defensive and insists that she did not have any romantic intentions whatsoever, so Jim relents, and the two continue watching TV together, but Cathy seems to get uncomfortably close to him. After Jim goes to the bathroom, he comes out to find her in only her underwear under his blanket. Fed up, he demands that she leave. Suddenly, Dwight charges in with chemicals to spray bed bugs. Jim keeps asking him to squirt Cathy to scare her away, which he does. However, because of the chemicals, Dwight tells Jim to sleep in Cathy's room. Jim instead spends time with Dwight in his room, eating Cathy's desserts and watching TV, while a drunken Nellie is outside, trying unsuccessfully to get in."
