        "Fed up with Andy, Nellie decides to prank him, printing a fake genealogy that shows him as a relative of First Lady Michelle Obama, who is known to have white relatives. Excited about being a relative of one of the most popular women in America, Andy announces this discovery to the entire office. He assumes his employees are equally as excited as he is, but Oscar actually forms a theory that Andy's ancestors were slave owners, that being the only possible explanation as to how he had a black relative. When Andy hears of this, he holds a meeting pointing out embarrassing relatives of his other co-workers (these also being made up by Nellie), most notably asserting that Jim was related to former President Richard Nixon. This, coincidentally, is something that Pam says often because of their supposed similar appearance.",
        "Meanwhile, Pam teaches Nellie how to drive, and on their trip, Pam realizes how cool Nellie actually is. She's impressed that she pulled such a clever prank on Andy and even talks to her about the feeling she has that Jim is keeping something from her. Nellie immediately thinks that Jim is having an affair, striking suspicion in Pam.",
        "Later, Jim finally tells his wife that he took the job he was offered in Philadelphia."
