        "In the cold open, Michael bumps into David BrentÂ outside an elevator. After realizing David is English, Michael tells him about a character he came up with and they immediately begin to tell each other racist jokes about British and Chinese people. When David points out the politically-incorrect nature of their joking, Michael corrects him saying it's just comedy and David agrees, saying, \"Comedy is a place where the mind goes to tickle itself\", then adding Michael's favorite catch phrase \"That's what she said.\" Michael then gives David a hug, and David asks if Dunder Mifflin is hiring. Michael says \"not right now\" and David asks him to drop a line if they do have any openings.",
        "In order to improve his worst-in-office sales totals Andy decides to hold a seminar on starting a small business. He originally enlists Jim to be one of the guest speakers, but Jim abruptly pulls out when he sees one of the audience members and quickly leaves. Seeing Jim leave, the other speakers (Dwight, Phyllis and Stanley) also pull out leaving Andy to replace them with Kevin, Creed and Ryan. Kevin's speech goes bad when he gets ill from running around the room and vomits in front of the audience. Kelly, who replaces Ryan, makes things slightly better when she calls up an old professor from her management training time at Yale (whom she may have slept with) to talk business lessons, but Creed ruins it when he goes into a speech about the Loch Ness Monster.",
        "Meanwhile, Erin is trying to beat Gabe in a game of Scrabble. Unfortunately, she's not very good, and the winner of their Scrabble games always picks the movie they watch. Since Gabe has already subjected her to numerous horror movies such as The Shining and The Ring, Erin desperately needs a win. With the help of Oscar and Pam, she almost beats Gabe but loses on the last turn, because she doesn't realize Oscar is trying to feed her a winning word (\"apoplexy\") and instead puts in the word \"ape\".",
        "After Jim spends all day outside of the office, Pam forces him to tell the camera crew why he's avoiding the guy he saw at the seminar. He and the man were childhood friends who were placed in separate reading groups in school (Jim was in the superior one). After his mom told him to hang out with his \"smart\" friends, Jim told his friend that \"mom says you're too dumb to hang out with.\" Jim eventually bumps into the guy in the break room, and tries to laugh off their history, but the guy mocks Jim for not being as successful as his superior intellect would have indicated, and snarks \"Where's your jet pack, Zuckerberg?\"",
        "Back at Andy's seminar, Dwight talks to one of the attendees, a man who owns a golf supply business, and realizes that this could actually be a good opportunity for the sales team. He, along with Phyllis and Stanley, try to rejoin Andy, who refuses at Darryl's prompting. At the end of the seminar, Andy is able to sell three packages, thanks to the advice of Michael, who has taken a Greek persona of \"Mykonos\" in order to impress Holly, who has broken up with AJ. With Holly playing his wife \"Necropolis\", Michael professes his love to her (in character). She amusedly walks away but Michael is hopeful.",
        "At the end of the day, Gabe shows Erin the movie they'll be watching that night, Hardware, which involves a killer robot (calling it a compromise because Erin wanted to watch WALL-E). As he is leaving, a confident Andy, who is still trying to win Erin back, hands her a copy of Shrek 2, leaving Erin visibly pleased."
