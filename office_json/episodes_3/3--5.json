    "storylines": [
        "Dwight abruptly begins to quiz Ryan with brain teasers, but becomes frustrated and screams \"Dammit!\" when Ryan recites answers to the puzzles, many before the full question is asked.",
        "Jan questions Michael's productivity and presses him on his accomplishments during the previous workday. Michael says he \"worked, went home to his condo, and Carol came over, and we had sex.\" Jan instructs Pam to log Michael's hourly activity \"so we can analyze it at Corporate\". Jan walks out of the office as Pam begins to protest.",
        "Dwight pesters Ryan about his excitement level for his first-ever sales call and informs the camera why he is so excited: Ryan has yet to make an ally within the office, and Dwight hopes to steer him clear of being a \"slacker-loser-wiseass like Jim\" and draft him in the \"Dwight army of champions.\" That afternoon, Dwight drives Ryan to a beet field, smirks to the cameraman in the backseat and tells Ryan \"Your journey begins now.\"",
        "At Dunder Mifflin Stamford, Karen is disturbed to find her chair squeaks and accuses Jim of a chair swap. He protests that he simply switched them back after she made the original switch. Karen promises to switch chairs while he's away from his desk, so he vows not to stand and proves such by rolling to the copy machine.",
        "On a phone call, Michael imitates Bill Cosby: \"I love Jell-O puddin' pops. My son Theo loves puddin' pops, too.\" Pam shows the camera \"Cosby Impression\" for the 10:00 hour in the log.",
        "Dwight asks Ryan to take the beet seed from his palm. Ryan misses and Dwight asks him to try again. However, Ryan is faster and takes the seed leaving Dwight in an awkward position. After that, The Assistant Regional Manager asks Ryan to plant the beet seed. Dwight says to the young salesman \"just as you planted that seed, I shall plant my seed in you\" to which the young salesman says \"I don't think you know what you're saying.\" Dwight says the bad odor in the area is \"called bull crap\" and states that \"clients can smell it from a mile away\". Dwight suddenly announces he forgot something in his car and runs toward the vehicle, gets in and speeds away.",
        "A loudspeaker announces free soft pretzels being given away in the lobby. Stanley and Michael immediately head for the door. In interviews, Stanley proclaims that pretzel day is his favorite day of the year, Pam admits it is a big deal for some people and Michael says he cannot be productive when there is one thing in his brain which he just can't get out, especially when that one thing is soft pretzels.",
        "A long pretzel line peeves Michael and he and Stanley rebuff Phyllis' attempt to jump the line with Bob Vance of Vance Refrigeration; Stanley sees past his disdain for Michael and high-fives him. Pam asks Michael to use his time in line to authorize some checks, but he instead has her hold his place in line while he uses the restroom. She offers to brings him a pretzel if Michael returns to the office, but he explains that if she ordered his pretzel incorrectly \"then ... this whole thing's blown.\" Shown to the camera, the productivity log now reads \"Stood in Pretzel line\" for the noon hour.",
        "Angry Ryan walks alone up a dirt road, muttering to himself. He knocks on a barn door, and Dwight jumps out: \"Congratulations, resourceful salesman! Welcome to Schrute Farm!\" Dwight then gives him his signature salute. Having passed Dwight's second challenge, Ryan sits in a Victorian-era wheelchair and Dwight assures him to \"Pay no attention to the spirits that haunt this hallowed ground!\"",
        "Dwight quizzes Ryan about Dunder Mifflin, the death of company cofounder Robert Mifflin, the purpose of the DHARMA Initiative, and Michael's greatest fear, to which Ryan answers \"loneliness. Maybe women.\" Dwight responds: \"Wrong. He's not afraid of anything. Also I would have accepted snakes\".",
        "Dwight later states that one cannot sell if one has fear \"You must vanquish fear.\" Suddenly, Cousin Mose appears with the word \"Fear\" on his shirt in tape, and Dwight tells Ryan as his final test he must wrestle Mose to the ground. Ryan calls Dwight a freak and storms out, despite Dwight's protests and instructions to get inside a coffin. Mose remarks \"he seemed nice,\" and Dwight asks \"Where are all the animals?\"",
        "At Stamford, Karen begins to continually squeak her chair. Jim quickly begins to sing the chorus of The Cardigans' \"Lovefool\", despite Karen's objections that the song is unfair retaliation and \"will be in her head all day.\" The camera pans to Andy, who is conducting and lip synching along with Jim's vocals, out of sight. In an interview, Andy completes the song's chorus — \"I don't care 'bout anything but you\" — and ponders the whereabouts of the band. Eventually the squeaky chair gets passed to Andy when he isn't in the room.",
        "Michael finally arrives at the front of the line and orders \"The Works\" — a sweet pretzel with all 18 sweet toppings. Back upstairs, he plays energetic music, then suddenly emerges from his office and launches into a hyperactive, sugar-fueled speech filled with suggestions on improving office efficiency.",
        "Inside his Trans Am, Dwight catches up with Ryan as he walks along the road, apologizes and displays gifts Mose sent, including fresh eggs, fatback bacon, and \"something he whittled,\" which appears to be a Venus of Willendorf figurine. After being pleaded with, Ryan gets in the car where Dwight explains that the lack of a friendship with Jim was the main impetus for the initiation ceremony. Dwight then begins to give Ryan sales-call pointers which Ryan tries to memorize. His final advice is for Ryan to \"K.I.S.S. — Keep It Simple Stupid.\"",
        "Michael sleeps face-down on his desk. Jan phones for him, but Pam says he's on a sales call.",
        "A dejected Ryan walks out of the sales call as Dwight tries to cheer him up. Ryan gripes that the potential client told him to his face that they didn't like him. In retaliation, Ryan begins to throw Mose's eggs at the building and CEO reserved parking sign. Surprised at Ryan's initiative, Dwight joins him, shouting \"Oh no, no, no,\" until two security guards saunter out, at which point the pair peel out of the parking lot in Dwight's Firebird. They go to a bar and drink boilermakers, and as a result of the day's events, Dwight no longer calls Ryan \"Temp\" but instead uses his given name.",
        "At the end of the work day, Pam realizes that Michael's antics helped him make a large sale. Having forgotten Kevin's phone extension, Jim calls Dunder Mifflin's main number, hoping to leave him a voicemail regarding a fantasy football issue. Pam answers and says she's staying late because of her new assignment to chronicle Michael's work day, a copy of which she promises to send to Jim. The pair enjoy a long chat about her tiny apartment and her scary solo movie night in which she rented 28 Days Later rather than 28 Days. They start to reconnect, but Ryan and Dwight, both exhausted, return to the office for a few seconds and she loudly says goodbye to the pair as they exit. Jim misconstrues the exclamation, and the pair hang up.",
        "A satiated Stanley remarks in an interview that in 364 days, it will once again be Pretzel Day."
