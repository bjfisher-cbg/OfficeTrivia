        "After he arrives to work in a new Porsche, we learn that Creed has been named the new acting manager based on seniority. He is performing exactly as you would expect him to perform."

    "storylines": [
        "With Deangelo Vickers still in a coma, Dunder Mifflin-Sabre Scranton is left with Creed as interim regional manager. Jo Bennett puts Jim, Toby and Gabe into a committee to interview candidates for the manager position, including Andy, Darryl and a number of outsiders, including a personal friend of hers, Nellie Bertram, who suggests various strange methods for running an office, including a \"zen garden\" theme and removal of all official titles for Dunder Mifflin Scranton. Pam takes it upon herself to protect the office and their clients from Creed's haphazard managerial style, such as distracting him with activities and pretending to be their own clients when Creed starts calling around with the false information that Dunder Mifflin is going out of business.",
        "Dwight, still upset over being demoted by Jo, stops taking care of himself and openly looks through want ads in the office. His attitude changes when he speaks with applicant Robert California, who disparages the position and the office to another manager candidate, Merv Bronte, in a manipulative effort to make him abandon his interview. Merv ruins his interview, and Dwight becomes incensed that the position might go to someone who doesn't take it seriously. He demands to be interviewed, and while Jim balks, after Dwight's persistent efforts to acquire an interview, Jo instructs Jim to grant him one, as she likes \"a little bit of crazy.\"",
        "Other interviewees include David Brent, who video conferences from England and raves about his own personal qualifications, Fred Henry, who claims he has a \"three-step plan\" for the office but will not reveal it, and Warren Buffett, who asks suspicious questions about long-distance calls policies and gas incentives.",
        "Darryl thinks his popularity with the staff (and his race) will make him a shoe-in, so he thinks he doesn't have to do an interview like everyone else. He is caught off guard when he actually must do an interview and they ask for his resume. Darryl writes up an overly-extensive four page resume, which Jo quickly derides, though Jim encourages Darryl by saying that the interview and resume are mere formalities for him. Darryl later brings in his daughter and attempts to use her to gain sympathy points, though he quickly realizes that it was a bad idea.",
        "When Andy interviews for the manager position, Gabe hijacks the meeting in an attempt to sabotage him by asking random trivia questions, most of which Andy is able to successfully answer, although Andy is still frustrated in the end. Gabe is also dismissive of Kelly during her interview. Kelly exacts revenge by telling Jo about his relationship with Erin and his harassing behavior after their breakup. In response, Jo sends Gabe back to Sabre's Florida headquarters, and installs Kelly to Gabe's position on the search committee. Jim eventually takes the discussion to the entire office (after Kelly accepts a bribe from Dwight to cast her vote for him), but the discussion gets out of control, and Jim brings the committee back to the conference room.",
        "Phyllis and Erin await the results of a DNA test to see if Erin is the daughter previously given up by Phyllis in high school. The results are negative, but Phyllis holds off on telling Erin after Andy rejects Erin's proposal to start dating again, and continues to show maternal affection toward her.",
        "Meanwhile, Angela becomes engaged to her state senator boyfriend, Robert. Oscar, who strongly believes that Robert is gay, shares his feelings with Pam, and the rest of the office. They eventually decide not to tell Angela out of respect for her feelings, despite Angela's constant obnoxious and upbeat attitude about her forthcoming nuptials.",
        "At the end of the episode, the cameras interview the people who were interviewed for the manager position. Andy's sure that he failed, and so is the guy with the glasses. The Finger Lakes guy is sure he succeeded, and so is Robert California. Dwight Schrute vows that he will either \"run this branch or destroy this branch.\" He then proceeds to storm out of the lobby."
