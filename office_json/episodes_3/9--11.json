He reflects on all the good times he and Jim had pretending to be brothers in order to better appeal to family-owned businesses. However, Jim is unable to help as he is in Philadelphia. Jim suggests that Dwight take Phyllis to pretend to be his sister, but Dwight refuses citing Phyllis as more likely to play his \"greatÂ great grandmother who died of stupidity\" to which Phyllis remarks that she heard that. Dwight tells Jim that if he drove 240 mph he could make it to Scranton in 30 minutes. Jim then asks how long it would take if he drove 300 mph and proceeds to hang up while Dwight is calculating it. Dwight is embarrassed and pretends to finish his conversation by thanking Jim for saying he is better than him. He accidentally says \"love you\" at the end and everyone looks at him.
