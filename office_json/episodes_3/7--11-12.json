        "Michael finds out that Holly will be replacing Toby while he is out on jury duty, and demands that Pam throw a new Christmas party to celebrate Holly's return. Michael wants the Christmas party to be \"classy\", and is resistant to doing any typical Christmas stuff that would be too childish or unsophisticated. He is under the impression that Holly will be single when she arrives, even though last time he saw her, she was dating A.J., her boyfriend from her last job. Pam gives Jim a homemade comic book for Christmas (The Adventures Of Jimmy Halpert), and worries that Jim may not like it, but he loves it and is extremely touched.",
        "Meanwhile, Darryl is worried that his daughter doesn't want to spend Christmas with him. He decides that he will try and convince her to spend Christmas with him by bringing her to the office Christmas party. He is dismayed when he finds out that Michael has decided to make the party \"classy\", thus making it no fun for kids. The employees of the office team up to give Darryl's daughter a fun scavenger hunt so she will be more interested in spending Christmas with her father. In the end she chooses to spend Christmas with Darryl, and Michael eventually dresses up in a traditional Santa costume.",
        "When Holly arrives, it turns out she is still dating her boyfriend, despite living far away from him. It is clear that she is somewhat disappointed that he hasn't proposed yet, and the women in the office encourage her to give him an ultimatum, which she decides to do. Michael is so upset about her still being with A.J. that he takes it upon himself to vandalize a “Toy Story” doll of Woody that A.J. gave her, which she keeps at her desk. She angrily asks who did it and after trying to frame Toby, Michael admits it was him and that he did it out of jealousy. Later he overhears her tell A.J. that she was the one who accidentally spilled food on the doll, and realizes that she’s forgiven him. Pam sees an upset Michael leave the party and follows him outside to tell him about the ultimatum, and points out that it means Holly and A.J.’s relationship probably won’t work out. Michael agrees and says he’s prepared to wait it out.",
        "Dwight challenges Jim to a snowball fight, which at first is all in good fun, but eventually gets intense. Jim is haunted constantly by the threat of getting hit with a snowball, and Dwight uses fear as his main weapon, disguising himself as a snowman in the parking lot in order to pound Jim with snowballs. Jim leaves work to find the parking lot populated with snowmen and frantically smashes them as a satisfied Dwight observes from the roof."
