        "Jim, Dwight, Pam, and Michael try to come up with ideas for Michael's 15 year anniversary. Jim is wearing a tuxedo, prompted by a memo sent by Dwight encouraging a more rigid dress code that happens to coincide with his and Angela's preferred manner of dress. Michael, impressed by Jim's classy attire, gives his ideas preferential treatment...even though Jim just rephrases Dwight's suggestions. Dwight storms out of the conference room in anger.",
        "If Jim had known that the new VP of Sales, Charles Miner, was coming today, he would not have worn the tuxedo. Charles is a tall, good-looking African-American man who instantly gets looks from the women in the office. Michael and Charles had met at a previous meeting with David Wallace and gotten along fine. Though Michael has gone to all the trouble of bringing in bagels from which he has cut out chunks so that they will resemble the letter C, he neglected to tell the staff their new VP was coming today. Charles is also unhappy to find out that Michael has not communicated some new guidelines to save money: watching expenses, managing petty cash flow, Corporate approval for overtime and fewer parties.",
        "Charles also notices Jim's tuxedo. Normally unflappable, Jim has a hard time explaining his reasoning. Charles looks unimpressed and slightly groans. Pam explains that it took 40 minutes to get ready.",
        "Michael quickly resents what he feels is his position being usurped. He calls David Wallace to complain about this unwanted supervision. When he tries to get personal information out of Charles, he is only able to learn that Charles used to work at Saticoy Steel. Michael is shocked that he didn't work in the paper industry and tells Charles that he doesn't need to be managed, explaining Ryan's and Jan's largely ineffective styles.",
        "Michael, worried, continues to call David. When David doesn't answer, Dwight tells the receptionist, Stephanie, that he is \"Michael Scotch\" and that he has David's son in the car held captive. Michael, shocked, calls back and says that everything is fine.",
        "Feeling uncomfortable at Charles' constantly watching him, Jim asks the camera not to document him. Michael and Charles get into an argument when Charles overrides Michael authorizing overtime for Kevin. After resorting to increasingly childish behavior, Michael orders the PPC into the conference room. In the meantime, Kelly asks Angela if she should seduce Charles. Angela snaps, \"No one wants to see that.\"",
        "After finding out from a resentful Phyllis that the PPC stands for Party Planning Committee and that hours are wasted on meetings, Charles bursts into the conference room to find out what they are doing. Michael protests that some great ideas for his party are being suggested, especially by Jim. Charles reads Jim's list which includes a two-way petting zoo (\"You pet the animals and they pet you back\") and instantly dissolves the committee.",
        "Furious that Charles won't allow the Party Planning Committee to continue, Michael threatens to call David Wallace. Charles explains that he will tell David what he needs to know. After several weeks in which David has come to realize that Michael has little control over his branch, contacts David constantly over issues he should be able to resolve himself and resorts to extreme tactics to get a return call, David has apparently realized that the Scranton branch succeeds despite Michael, not because of him. This policy has been implemented so that Charles will perform the same role as Jan and Ryan, limiting Michael's contact with David. Not wanting to give up having the CFO's ear, Michael storms off to New York to confront David.",
        "Knowing he's gotten off on the wrong foot with Charles, Jim tries to explain that he really is a hard worker, a productive employee and a good second-in-command. Charles apparently was never told that Jim is the office's number two and Jim doesn't do a good job of explaining it, leaving Charles to believe that this is just an imaginary position.",
        "Michael arrives at Corporate and catches David coming out of the men's room, furious that he's been brushed off all day due to alleged meetings. He protests that he's worked for the company for 15 years, has been loyal to it and made sacrifices for it. He shouldn't have to drive all the way to New York City to speak with the CFO. David agrees and attempts to placate Michael by allowing the 15th Anniversary Party and telling him that he will attend it. Michael realizes he's being humored and he abruptly quits Dunder Mifflin. As he walks out the door he says, \"You have no idea how high I can fly\".",
        "Kelly tries to get Charles to date her but sees Angela in the parking lot. Angela says that Charles and Kelly are not meant for each other because \"Charles is a sophisticated man, and he doesn't need to go dumpster diving for companionship\"."
