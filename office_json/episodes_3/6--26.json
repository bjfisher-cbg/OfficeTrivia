        "After the press grills Michael about Sabre's printers catching on fire, CEO Jo Bennett shows up to the office. Jo smolders as she explains that the defect was found recently and the company was just about to send out a software patch with a letter offering free toner to those affected by the defect. Instead, someone took it upon themselves to alert the media and cause a massive PR problem for the company. She wants to know who it was. Because Andy found out about the problem first, most of the employees believe he's the responsible person. Jo decides to start at the top and pulls Michael into the conference room to interrogate him. She's always believed that an innocent person would recommend a harsh punishment. Michael does not disappoint. He is also adamant that none of his people would have leaked the story.",
        "Dwight refuses to waste any time. He immediately denies responsibility and gives Jo a long list of people she should fire. She's satisfied. Changing the subject, she mentions his very profitable year. Dwight doesn't have any real ideas as to where to go next. She strongly suggests he invest in real estate. After a lot of consideration, Dwight attempts to buy the Scranton Business Park and suggests in a conversation with Hank the security guard that he will implement sweeping changes to the place.",
        "Meanwhile, while Sabre's IT guy, Nick, checks everyone's computers for evidence, Michael is pressured by the others to get Andy to confess. Andy points out that Darryl was just as upset about the issue. After confronting Darryl, Michael is stunned when Darryl admits to disclosing the information to a woman at a bar who turned out to be a journalist. Then Pam confesses to Jim that she mentioned it in casual conversation with another mother at the day-care center whose husband also happened to be a journalist. When she tells Michael, he asks her and Darryl to meet him in Meredith's van. Kelly joins them as she revealed the news on Twitter out of boredom. The three suggest to Michael that he should try to talk to Jo about the situation so that they can confess without losing their jobs.",
        "When Michael changes his tune about harshly punishing the whistleblower, Jo realizes that he knows who it is. He refuses to name names. Jo takes him to her private plane and changes tactics. He admits his life hasn't been great this year. Besides the many small things that have made him realize he's not satisfied, he desperately misses Holly. Jo opens up about how she'd always dreamed of being a powerful woman who could set an example for young girls. Instead, she's going to be remembered as someone who sells cheap printers that burst into flames. There's a press release that someone will have to read and she's dreading having to do it. Michael offers to \"fall on his sword\" and announce the public apology for her.",
        "Back at the office, Gabe finishes interviewing everyone and deduces that Andy is the one who talked with the press. Everyone tries to suggest that it could be someone else, perhaps even Gabe. At that moment, Nick suddenly announces that he is quitting to go teach inner-city children in Detroit how to use computers. The employees don't even know his name and aren't interested in his news. In retaliation, Nick reveals all their private information he found on their computers, including that he found on Andy's computer the Quicktime video he shot with Darryl and a message he emailed to a local newspaper.",
        "At the end of the day, Andy finds himself harassed by the other employees. However, Erin commends Andy's bravery, and he leaves smiling.",
        "Michael is shown giving a public apology to a news crew, after which Jo tells him she will owe him a favor. When Michael jokingly asks to bring Holly back to Scranton, Jo responds by telling him that she will look into it, leaving him at a loss of words as the episode ends."
