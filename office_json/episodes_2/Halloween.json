Michael knows it's because he was supposed to fire someone by the end of the month. So far, he has been putting it off hoping someone would quit, move, or die so he wouldn't have to do it. Of course, he has no idea who he is going to let go. Michael goes to the Accounting Department (Kevin, Angela, and Oscar) and asks them to find $50,000 in the budget (basically, a salary and benefits), who come to the conclusion that the Accounting Department has three people doing the work of two, but don't tell Michael. Dwight gets on Jim's nerves so he and Pam decide to post Dwight's resume on the web. Angela gets mad at Pam for bringing brownies instead of chips and dip to the office party. Dwight's resume gets a hit from a company in Maryland, so Jim plays Michael and gives Dwight a great reference. When the company, Cumberland Mills, calls Dwight to set up an interview, Dwight immediately ruins his chances by having a rather stern argument with the caller over the importance and relevance of martial arts."},{"type":"paragraph","text":"Pam thinks Jim should be the one to be getting better job offers and mentions to Jim that, given the salary and growth potential there, he should apply for the Cumberland Mills job. Jim is clearly hurt by the suggestion, thinking that perhaps Pam wouldn't care if he left. Pam tries to back-pedal but Jim makes clear his feelings. Michael tries to practice his firing skills with Jim, but doesn't fire him. Michael decides to fire Creed, after unsuccessfully trying to fire Pam and Stanley. Creed is unwilling to be fired so he talks Michael into letting Devon go, which he does. Devon retailiates by smashing a pumpkin on Michael's car. As Jim is leaving to go home, Pam apologises for pushing him into taking the Cumberland job and reassures him that she would 'blow her brains out' if he ever left. In a talking head, Jim brushes off the remark, saying that if Pam were the one leaving, he wouldn't necessarily blow his brains out...though he would take the Cumberland Mills job. At the end of the episode, we see a guilty Michael alone at home on Halloween, handing out candy to trick-or-treaters."}],"images":[]},{"title":"Trivia","level":2,"content":[{"type":"list","elements":[{"text":"Dwight sends the supplement for his resume to \"Charles Weed\" (at Cumberland Mills).","elements":[]},{"text":"Michael tells Oscar he probably wishes he could wear his female costume all the time, possibly foreshadowing the fact that Oscar is gay.","elements":[]},{"text":"While Dwight was not one of the co-workers Devon invited to Poor Richard's after being fired, in \"Finale\" Dwight states that he likes Devon, and has re-hired him following Creed's \"death\".","elements":[]},{"text":"This is the only episode to feature a quote over the Deedle-Dee logo.","elements":[]}]}],"images":[]},{"title":"Deleted scenes","level":2,"content":[{"type":"paragraph","text":"The Season Two DVD contains a number of deleted scenes from this episode.
