Unfortunately for Michael, Dwight seems to be the only one joining in, as the rest of the employees are more concerned with Kevin, who is awaiting his results from his skin cancer screening. Pam and Jim meanwhile decide to sneak out and go to the store to shop for gifts for Kevin."},{"type":"paragraph","text":"When Michael finds out about Kevin's predicament, he gives Kevin his condolences, but subtly remains bitter that Kevin is ruining his birthday fun. Dwight and Angela are less subtle than they think they are being when discussing their secret relationship within earshot of Ryan. After goofing around at the store, Jim and Pam return to the office. To \"make Kevin feel better\", Michael takes the employees out ice skating. At the rink, he also runs into his real estate agent Carol with her children and he entertains them, which puts a smile on Carol's face. Kevin gets the call about his results, which turn up negative, to everyone's relief except for Michael's who believes that negative meant he did have cancer. He later explains that \"Apparently, in the medicine community, negative means good, which makes absolutely no sense. In the real world community, ye-that would be... chaos.\" The gifts are passed out to Kevin and Michael and Pam expresses her feelings on the \"great day\"."}],"images":[]},{"title":"Deleted scenes","level":2,"content":[{"type":"paragraph","text":"The Season Two DVD contains a number of deleted scenes from this episode.
