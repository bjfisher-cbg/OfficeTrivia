Meanwhile, Jim does an impression of Stanley and gets caught. When he and Pam speak at the same time (impersonating Stanley's response), Pam calls \"jinx\" so Jim can't talk until he buys her a Coke, which isn't an issue until he discovers the vending machine is sold out. When Dwight sets up urine testing, Michael worries that a \"clove cigarette\" he smoked at an Alicia Keys concert will show up."},{"type":"paragraph","text":"Michael holds an anti-drug meeting for the entire office, where he over-expresses his hatred of drugs. He tries to get out of the testing, but Dwight continues to insist that he must take part. Michael pressures Dwight for a cup of his \"clean\" urine, but Angela is against the idea. Jim continues to hold up his end of the jinx. Pam continues to tease him, until she gets to the point where she says, \"you can tell me anything\", which creates an awkward silence. Michael passes his drug test (with Dwight's urine); Dwight turns in his volunteer badge over his actions. Pam buys Jim his Coke, which he buys off of her so she can find out what's been happening with Dwight the whole day. Michael feels guilty, so he makes Dwight an \"Honorary Security Advisor\" for Dunder Mifflin Scranton. Jim wonders aloud what Dwight gets out of his relationship with Michael, while the camera focuses on him and Pam, suggesting that the two have a similarly confusing relationship."}],"images":[]},{"title":"Deleted scenes","level":2,"content":[{"type":"list","elements":[{"text":"Jim does impressions of Kevin and Angela for Pam.","elements":[]},{"text":"In a talking head interview, Dwight is so determined to find the culprit that he is prepared to pray \"to Thor himself.\"","elements":[]},{"text":"In a talking head interview, Toby doesn't think Michael is taking drugs, but maybe he should.","elements":[]},{"text":"Jim secretly does an impression of Dwight right in front of him.","elements":[]},{"text":"In a talking head interview, Dwight talks about Jim and concludes, \"If that were my life, I'd do drugs.\"","elements":[]},{"text":"Phyllis tells Stanley that she told Dwight he wasn't acting withdrawn.

There are a number of errors on this list. Firstly, \"blow\" is a common street name for cocaine, which is already listed. \"Crack\" is also a form of cocaine. Hookah is not a drug, but rather a method of smoking tobacco called \"shisha\" that is often mixed with fruit mixtures, as Toby explains in the episode. Additionally, the list features many slang terms from drugs, not the actual term. In addition to \"blow\", \"speed\" is slang for amphetamines, \"acid\" is slang for LSD, and \"pot\" is slang for marijuana.
