After Andy buys a top-of-the-line printer \"that is good for head shots\" and asks David to pay for him to have cheek implants, David informs the camera crew that, \"At a certain point, the ice gets too thin, and you fall through. And that is when you get fired.\" Andy attempts to get enough strength to quit his job and pursue his dream as an actor and talks to David about it in his office before he even has the chance to fire Andy. He changes his mind twice, but eventually he makes up his mind and leaves the office. As a goodbye, Andy serenades the rest of the office employees, who initially dismissed Andy's dream as a giant mistake, with a beautiful and moving rendition of Sarah McLachlan's song \"I Will Remember You\". He also defecates on the hood of David Wallace's new car."
