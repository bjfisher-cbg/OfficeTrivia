Michael is initially bothered that his co-workers were so excited to see Chet Montgomery on the screen when he intended that the video be shown for his co-workers to see himself. Montgomery was shown in the video to contrast that Michael hadn't achieved his shared wish in the show, while Montgomery had done so as a great accomplishment."}],"images":[]},{"title":"Trivia","level":2,"content":[{"type":"paragraph","text":"The \"Doppler 7\" is likely a reference to the absurdly named \"Live Mega Doppler 7000 HD\" radar used to track weather precipitation by KABC-TV (local ABC affiliate) in Los Angeles where the show is produced.
