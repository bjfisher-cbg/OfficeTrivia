She is 9 years old and her parents, Darryl and Justine, are divorced. Jada appears in only 3 episodes: Classy Christmas, Search Committee, and Free Family Portrait Studio. She decides to spend Christmas of 2010 with her mother because she thinks it'll be more fun than staying with her father. But, Darryl succeeds in winning her back. He gathers together a few office employees (Andy and Pam) to act out a Dr. Seuss-esque \"Grinch\" scenario for her to play in."}],"images":[]}]}
