She is displayed as a crass, rude, irrational, and professionally\/socially inept woman. However, despite all her shortcomings, she is also ambitious and opportunistic, applying for jobs that she is often unqualified for. While difficult to get used to, Nellie is eventually shown to be very friendly towards her co-workers, and generally on good terms with most of them, with the noted exception of Andy Bernard, who held a bitter resentment towards her for stealing his job."}],"images":[]},{"title":"Biography","level":2,"content":[{"type":"paragraph","text":"Nellie was born in the working class town of Basildon, England, where she grew up in poverty. Until the age of 32, she talked in a \"horrendous\" cockney accent. She appears to be religious, as she has mentioned that she attends church. She claims to have once had a one-night stand with Hugh Grant's elder brother, John Grant, an act that she states she completed by \"sheer force of will\" (it is possible that this may be just one of her many lies). She had a long-term relationship with a stage magician, only to have him suddenly leave her for a waitress and vanish from her life. Her stated philosophy in business is \"if the seat is open, the job is open\", a motto which had led her to briefly race a Formula One car (for what were the three slowest laps ever recorded). She openly admits to her shortcomings, such as having little formal education, no real skills, and a lack of motivation."},{"type":"paragraph","text":"Despite her outwardly tough appearance, Nellie appears to be quite vulnerable. Her massive credit card debt implies that she is a shopaholic. In addition, it is implied that she suffers from depression and loneliness, with her move from England to the United States only aggravating it. In response, she tried (and ultimately failed) to adopt a child. In the show's finale, however, she \"adopts\" the child Ryan abandoned for a new life with Kelly."},{"type":"paragraph","text":"She shares a mutual acquaintance with Sabre CEO, Jo Bennet."}],"images":[]},{"title":"Season 7","level":2,"content":[{"type":"paragraph","text":"Nellie made her debut in Search Committee, interviewing for the Regional Manager position at the Dunder Mifflin Scranton branch, but during the course of her interview, she proves herself to be woefully inept for the position.

She also suggests a \"Zen\" office with no desks and a masseuse named Sockee.

In Test the Store, after Dwight successfully manages to open Sabre's very first store, Nellie appoints him as Vice President. However, in Last Day in Florida, Dwight is supplanted by Packer, just in time for Packer to be fired when Robert California shuts down the retail endeavor. In Get the Girl, after the failure of the Sabre store, Nellie travels to the Scranton branch, and decides that, with Andy absent (in Florida, declaring his love for Erin), the time is perfect for her to take over his job. Her goofy enthusiasm and non-detailed plan to give everyone raises eventually wins over most of the office, but Jim is clearly opposed to her, with Robert California being unable to stand up to her and taking on a detached Darwinian view of her antics. In Angry Andy, when Andy finally returns from his successful quest to win Erin's heart, Nellie simply refuses to leave the office, and California refuses to make her leave. Throughout the episode, Andy becomes so infuriated that he ultimately convinces the CEO to demote and then fire him, leaving Nellie as the official branch Manager. In Free Family Portrait Studio, Andy is appointed Regional Manager again, after David Wallace buys Dunder Mifflin from Sabre with the $20 million that he got from selling a toy-vacuum invention to the United States Military.

Darryl then realizes, after watching her struggle with the mechanics of consuming one, that she truly is trying to be nice to and socialize with her employees. In Turf War, Pam discovers many of Nellie's personal troubles and decides to be nicer to her, striking up a friendly conversation. Nellie reveals to the camera crew that she is deeply moved to have a real friend within the office.

On the bus, Nellie entrusts Erin to help her with her adoption agency letter as Erin was once up for adoption herself. With Erin's help, Nellie tries again to persuade Andy to sign the letter. He again rebuffs her, telling her how awful the letter is and how her dream of adopting a child will never come true. This upsets Erin more than it does Nellie and Nellie comforts Erin.
