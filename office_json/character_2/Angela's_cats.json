In an earlier season, Angela also claims that Sprinkles had a litter and offered to sell off the kittens to Pam."

Angela shouted up to Oscar, who had crawled up the vents, \"Save Bandit!\" Unfortunately, Oscar failed to catch Bandit and Bandit fell through a hole in the ceiling. He survived the fall and continued to be kept in one of Angela's desk drawers. He is seen later on chewing a cord on the copier. He is also seen in the episode \"The Delivery\" where Jim puts a diaper on him for practice for when he does it with his soon-to-be-born daughter."
