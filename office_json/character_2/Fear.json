{"sections":[{"title":"Fear","level":1,"content":[{"type":"paragraph","text":"Fear can be met in an episode of The Office, embodied by Mose Schrute , the most intimidating man on planet earth and beyond. This scene takes place in \"Initiation\" when Ryan is taught by Dwight how to become successful. You can truly see the dark, bioling abyss within Mose's lifeless, beaty eyes. The terror just from glancing upon him is surreal. Ryan was not a worthy opponent, as he fled from the fight like a coward, although he didn't stand a chance anyways."}],"images":[{"src":"https:\/\/vignette.wikia.nocookie.net\/theoffice\/images\/0\/00\/Fear.jpg\/revision\/latest\/scale-to-width-down\/400?cb=20190530040242","caption":"\"You will now wrestle my cousin Mose (Fear).\""}]}]}
