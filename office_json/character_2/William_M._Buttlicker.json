He also goes by Bill Buttlicker, and is one of Dwight Schrute's biggest clients. Buttlicker is a hearing-impaired old man whose family built this country. Dwight made fun of his unfortunate surname, and Buttlicker was very offended. After Dwight disrespectfully yelled at him the iconic words \"BUTTLICKER! OUR PRICES HAVE NEVER BEEN LOWER!\" Buttlicker becomes very irate and describes Dwight as being aggresive, hostile, and difficult. However, when Dwight transfers him to his boss, Michael Scott , Buttlicker agrees to buy $1,000,000 worth of paper products with the condition that Dwight is fired. \"Customer Survey\" is his only appearance."}],"images":[{"src":"https:\/\/vignette.wikia.nocookie.net\/theoffice\/images\/7\/70\/Buttlicker.png\/revision\/latest\/scale-to-width-down\/279?cb=20190530034616","caption":"\"My family built this country, by the way.\""}]}]}
