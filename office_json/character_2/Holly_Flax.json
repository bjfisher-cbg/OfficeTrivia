Flax. Michael had been courting Holly in the first episode of the season; Holly continues to be a \"major dork\" (in the words of Jim Halpert) just like Michael. Holly learns that Kevin is not actually mentally challenged, as she had been duped into believing during season 4 by Dwight. Holly practices yoga, so Oscar refers Holly to a yoga class (with an attractive teacher). Holly agrees to a date with him, much to Michael's dismay. Holly buys tickets for Counting Crows, but the yoga instructor goes back on his word and doesn't call her after he promised he would. Michael, who does not pick up on several hints that Holly has given him (about attending the concert with her), purchases the tickets from her and rips them to pieces. While Holly appears to have a higher sense of morality than Michael (and has shown disapproval toward some of his ideas and schemes), she ultimately considers him to be her best friend in the office. It is also revealed that she was picked on as a child just like Michael.  Michael tells Holly he will treat her poorly in front of Jan during her baby shower because he has a vested interest in Jan's baby, which is not his (Sperm Donor). He expected Jan to still be pregnant, but she arrives with the baby already born. Nevertheless, Michael still treats Holly poorly. Despite being told of this, she is shown to be uncomfortable with Michael's attitude toward her. In a deleted scene, when Michael is treating her poorly, she tells the camera crew she sees what life was like in the office for Toby, who is on speakerphone agreeing with her. However, despite witnessing Michael's treatment of Holly throughout the day, Jan notices the two of them have a lot in common after Holly makes jokes in front of her. Jan then orders Michael not to date Holly before driving away. This, in addition to feeling no connection with Jan's baby, prompts Michael to hug Holly for treating her poorly and ask her out on a date, which she accepts, visibly moved. Holly and Michael date, and on their third date, they have sexual relations in the office (inadvertently leading to the break-in at the office). She helps Michael organize a fundraiser (offering yoga lessons) and displeases CFO David Wallace, who sees them kissing, thus noticing a relationship. In response, she is transferred back to Nashua. She and Michael plan to continue dating, but realize on the trip that the distance is insurmountable. Thus, they are forced to end their relationship, sharing one last embrace before saying goodbye. Michael tells everyone that they are engaged upon his return but later admits this is not true. Later, David is called out on the transfer by Michael, who chastises him on the phone before hanging up."},{"type":"paragraph","text":"When Michael comes to Nashua with Pam Beesly to give his lecture and find closure with Holly, she is not there because she is on an HR retreat. It is also revealed that she is dating one of the salesmen there, A.J., which deeply upsets Michael and makes him unable to do his presentation. He makes an attempt to but he ultimately breaks down and asks her boyfriend about Holly in front of everyone before leaving. He goes to her desk and smells her sweater, cutting a sleeve off to take with him. Doing so he hits her mouse and her computer awakens from sleep mode. Michael finds a file on her computer titled \"Dear Michael\" and copies it to his flash drive. He tells Pam about it, and Pam claims it wasn't a good idea and that he shouldn't read it because it is a violation of her trust. Pam volunteers to read it herself and deletes it afterward, telling Michael it said she still has feelings for him and that it isn't over, which makes Michael happy. It is unclear whether Pam was telling the truth."},{"type":"paragraph","text":"Holly and Michael reunite at the Dunder Mifflin company picnic for the first time since she was transferred. She is still seeing A.J., who arrives with her. Holly and A.J. have apparently started living together, though Michael holds himself together. Michael makes a number of tongue-in-cheek jabs at A.J., though Holly and A.J. don't respond to it. David Wallace lets Holly and Michael do a skit about the history of Dunder Mifflin, and the two spend time in the woods by themselves trying to think of ideas. Michael wants to find a time to talk about a possible reconciliation but restrains himself. The two decide to do a skit that spoofs Slumdog Millionaire. The presentation goes horribly and gets worse when they reveal that the Buffalo branch is closing down, much to everyone's surprise. Michael and Holly reminisce about the presentation and talk about one in the future. Holly leaves with A.J., with Michael noting that it wasn't the right time to talk to her and that they will eventually find each other again someday."}],"images":[{"src":"https:\/\/vignette.wikia.nocookie.net\/theoffice\/images\/8\/84\/Holly4.jpg\/revision\/latest\/scale-to-width-down\/180?cb=20101114164355","caption":""},{"src":"https:\/\/vignette.wikia.nocookie.net\/theoffice\/images\/1\/13\/Holly3.jpg\/revision\/latest\/scale-to-width-down\/180?cb=20101114163542","caption":""}]},{"title":"Season 6","level":2,"content":[{"type":"paragraph","text":"Holly Flax is mentioned by Michael several times through several episodes.
